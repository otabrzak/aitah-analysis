"I met my friend when I was in a very vulnerable point in my life. We became very close friends but I always felt like she took advantage of my kindness but I didn't do anything because I was happy that I atleast had friends.

After 2 years I moved to a different city and became very busy and this upset her, I tried my best and messaged her and called her whenever I could but she accused me of not telling her what's going on in my life when the truth is there was absolute nothing happening.

Soon I found out through someone from our friend group that she had a girlfriend and she didn't tell me, I didn't have a problem with it but she accused me of not telling her what happened in my life.  I didn't bring it up because I valued our friendship more. 

After this all she would talk about was her girlfriend and I didn't want to listen to intimate details about their s*x life so I told her politely to stop

She later broke up with her and asked me to convince her not to go back to her girlfriend and I said some pretty mean stuff about her girlfriend because she asked me to.

We later met up with our friends group and she treated me like absolute sh*t and ignored me for most of the day and made remarks about how annoying my voice was and that I wouldn't shut up.

I couldn't take it anymore and I called her asking her why she was acting like this,  at first she denied it but then went on a rant saying that she was offended by what I said about her girlfriend, and that I wasn't interested in what was going on in her life  because she needed a friend to share what was going on (I.e the long ass stories about her girlfriend) and I wasn't there for her. She accused me of calling her a gamer girl and saying that she had weird hair( which I did as a joke while she constantly calls my new friends ugly) and also I later found out through her girlfriend that they had broken up again which was why she was acting weird.

All our friends hate me for breaking up our friends group, AITA?",Not the A-hole,0
"I (51m) was in a 23 year relationship with my partner (m51), until he ended things by falling in love with a new guy.  In Nov 2019 I got him (us) a 10 day vacation for his birthday. It was paid for 50% in advance.  The trip was supposed to be in June of 2020. In March of 2020 COVID lockdown happened.  So the hotel allowed us to bump the reservation one year out. He broke up with me in November of 2020. So we never got a chance to go on the vacation. Now I'm left with a half paid vacation.  So I requested a refund. Our separation involved me giving him a large sum of money,  as we settled up our estates.  So technically I never really gave him the present at all for his 2019 birthday.  I didn't really want to give him a vacation that he would then use with his new boyfriend. I didn't really want to give him a half paid vacation. And I didn't feel like paying the full amount for the balance now that he's leaving me. Am I the asshole?",Not the A-hole,0
"I(22M) live in an apartment with my roommate(22M). We are both attending college part-time and get along well with one another. The lease is under my name only, my roommate is not planning on living in the apartment after college. I do work night shift 3 days a week. My hours are 7PM-7:00AM. He sometimes has his girlfriend stay overnight, which is no problem as my boyfriend will stay when he visits. 

When I come home from work, I have been noticing my bed has been a mess and I've found clothing that did not belong to me in the sheets. I am awful with confronting people, but I know it's not my boyfriend as he lets me know beforehand when he is staying over. I ordered a camera and placed it in a spot where it can't be seen. I went into work and the camera app notified me that there was motion in the room. I turned the camera on and saw my roommate and his girlfriend on my bed. I was mortified and stopped watching the video. 

My boyfriend came over in the morning and I showed him the video of my roommate and girlfriend on my bed. My boyfriend texts the video to my roommate and he texts back that he wants to talk when he gets home. Roommate and I talk about the situation and I tell him that it's disgusting that he and his girlfriend are using my bed. Roommate's defense is that the bed is more comfortable than his. His girlfriend comes over in the evening and she starts attacking me for putting a camera in the apartment.

"A few days ago I (22f) went grocery shopping after work. While waiting in line, a mother and daughter (5 years old at most) were chatting right behind me. I didn't really pay attention to them until the girl told her mom to lean down and she 'whispered' the way kids try to ""Mom, why is the lady in front of us so ugly?"" The poor mother was mortified and immediately apologized to me over and over again and had her daughter apologize as well. I accepted it and said no worries to ease her nerves because, well, it's a kid and they blurt stuff out. It happens and her observation wasn't even incorrect unfortunately.  


On the other hand, I've been having an awful week and couldn't stop myself from crying after turning back around. I have awful self-confidence, and while I knew the child wasn't being malicious it still hurt. There were still 2 people in front of me and I waited in line trying not to be too noticeable. While I wasn't wailing or anything you could probably hear me sniffling, and my eyes were definitely red and puffy by the time I checked out and basically ran outside. My roommates noticed I had been crying when I got home and asked me what had happened, but when I told them they said I was being a jerk. They said I should've just left my groceries there and gone home and that I probably embarrassed the mother even more in front of everyone because I was being dramatic.   


To be honest I thought about leaving the line and putting my cart off to the side. I could have done that, left and come back the next day to shop, but I had no food for myself at home and didn't want to not eat for basically a day since I start work early and can't afford to eat out.

"
My roommate comes from a house where they don’t flush their toilet paper (not sure if it’s because of their septic system or culture) and I’ve noticed our bathroom trash can filling up very fast. No matter how many air fresheners I leave in there, it always smells like shit, literally.

I finally asked her if she was throwing away her TP instead of flushing as gently as I could. She said yes and I let her know she’s free to flush it here, it won’t cause any flooding or damage. I told her my dad used to live in the country and we had to throw our TP away for the sake of our septic system, so I understand where she’s coming from. She said ok and started flushing for the next week or so. 

This week she started throwing the paper away again. I texted her and said if she wanted to throw her used toilet paper away instead of flushing it, I had to ask that she buy a trash can with a lid as I really don’t want to see or smell it. 

She immediately came out of her room and threw the trash bag with used TP in our kitchen trash can (literally not better) and was pretty huffy. I said thank you, she rolled her eyes and went back to her room. A few minutes later she texted me saying I made a big deal of nothing and that was just how things worked in her house. Her friend, a fellow roommate, agreed and accused me of being culturally insensitive. I told her I understood, I used to live in a house without the ability to flush as well, I just didn’t want to see or smell it. Again she said I didn’t understand and was being pushy for no reason.

I thought I came up with a respectful compromise, but am I the asshole here?  I tried to be as delicate as I could and I didn’t want to embarrass her in anyway.

Edit: for context her family is from Africa, however she was born and raised in America. So when I say culture, I mean her families culture.",Not the A-hole,0
"    My friend (18m) moved in with his coworkers (24f) and her bf (18m). I helped with the move and cleaning everything. My friend was doing his best to save money and move in slowly. He didn’t really own a lot of stuff so he slept on an air mattress and borrowed various items from people until he got settled in. The roommates didn’t do that. They fully furnished their room right away with nightstands and a queen size bed. Even impulse bought a Guinea pig. 

     The day after they bought the nightstands the older roommate called me crying about how she only had 76 cents in her account and how she had a kid (f5) and that she needed money to feed her or if an emergency came up. In my head I was thinking “you just spent all your money buying unnecessary stuff that could’ve waited” but I didn’t say it and went to talk to my friend who gave her 500 for her kid and food and such. She was very thankful

   And then the next day she messaged me sending pictures of a Guinea pig she bought saying how she’s such an impulsive buyer. I got mad cause the day before she was crying about not having money then buys a pet. And assumed she used my friends money he gave her. So I told her bf the other roommate and he tells her and she proceeds to message me saying that it was her boyfriends money and he vemnoed it. I apologized but ever since they’ve been acting cold.

"So my history teacher had finished teaching and we had some time left so we just chilled. My friend had to use the bathroom for um. Body mad she didn't have a body(perfect way to put it 😌) and i had to change mine out so we went to the teacher I asked for us this was the conversation 
Me""hey me and bff have to go to the bathroom. Its that time of the month.""
HT(history teacher)""oh yeah? Or are you just going their to have sex?""
Im bi. Bff is aro/ace. The teacher knows this
Me""what? No we just need to use the bathroom""
HT""just hold it in OP-""
I blew up at her. Telling her she knows you cant hold a period in. I was sent to the principal office. Bff was told to sit down. I came back and i saw bff crying outside. She told me that it had exploded while she stod up to get some paper and the students laughed their heads off. I was so mad i was about to storm in their and yell at everyone for laughing at bff. She told me i was overreacting a bit and ask if id call her mom. Her dad answered and I told him to bring her some new underwear and pants. He asked why. I told him because of period. He asked ""well why didn't you hold it in?""
I had no patience for him. I yelled at him telling him you cant hold it in and you're just like HT. I hung up on him and gave the phone back to bff. Im starting to fell bad now. I don't think I should have blewn up in HT or ED's faces about something small. But at the same time bff has had periods before and HT is a female so those two should know how this work. Idk anymore.

"I married my husband in mid 2017. We're now divorcing for reasons that aren't relevant to this post.

After we married, my parents gave my husband what they insisted was a dowry, meaning a cash gift just for marrying me. The amount was an even 10k. My husband and I agreed to put it in our joint savings account which we were using to save for a house.

We didn't buy the house, and we split up. When we split, we had about 45k in the joint account, which we split 18k/27k, with me getting the larger amount because it was my parents who gave us that 10k. We've not formally divorced yet, but we've been separated since October 2020.

Last year, my parents and I had a fight, and we've been on bad terms since. To give you an idea of how bad, they've only found out that my husband and I separated last week, and one of the first things they said to me is that they want the dowry back.

They're well off, so this isn't a financial issue, but they said that the money was meant to go towards a house and grandkids, and now those aren't happening any time soon they want their 10k returned.

Here's the thing: my understanding has always been that we were given the money just because we got married, and we could spend it on anything at all, so these conditions are new. Additionally, in the last year, my income has been reduced both by going from a 2 income household to just me, and by my workplace shutting down. I've already had to use about 8k of savings, so while I could give the money back to them in full, my remaining savings would go from 19k to 9k, which is a very steep drop.

I explained this to my parents, who said that I could figure it out and that they thought it was understood that the money they gave me for getting married was conditional on me *staying* married.

I don't want to return the money, and I've told them this. I feel that as they gave me the money for getting married, and the marriage ended due to no fault of my own, they're being unfair by asking me to return it, especially when the cost of returning it will be over half my savings.

They've called me an arsehole and a thief, saying that it's their money, I'm being an entitled, spoilt brat, and I owe it to them to return it. My younger sister agrees with them.

"My partner (F 27) and I (F 29) have been together since high school (12+ years) and ever since I got my driver's license, I have been the primary driver in the relationship.  My partner and I live between two large cities in which a lot of events and activities take place that we both enjoy participating in, and while a handful of these events/activities occur a stone's throw away from our town, sometimes they can take us 1-2 hours out of the way driving distance.  I was fine with all of this when the long-distance commitments were more infrequent ( as in maybe every other month), but over the past couple of years, they've started becoming a monthly and twice-monthly occurrence.

I have asked in the past if my partner wouldn't mind being the one to drive every once and a while, as between gas, car maintenance, and just general fatigue, it's not always been ideal for me to drive.  She has always responded that 1.) she doesn't like to drive, and 2.) she's scared of driving on the freeway.  The first excuse I admit I find a little annoying given that, frankly, I don't ""like"" to drive either, but I do it so that we can have fun and enjoy a day out.  The second excuse is the one I'm sympathetic to given we live in an area that is notorious for bad freeway drivers and frequent accidents.  For the record, my partner has never been in a vehicular accident or had a loved one be in an accident, she just fears that one might happen to her.

To her credit, she has told me repeatedly that she's making improvements on getting acclimated to driving on the freeway, but she's been telling me this for about 8 years now and she still insists that she isn't ready to drive us to an event/activity.

Since Covid, events have obviously come to a standstill, but with new regulations and safety precautions (both she and I are vaccinated and wear masks and social distance), events are starting to ramp up again.  She's more eager than ever to go to several large events since we've missed out for a whole year and most of these are in those farther 1-2 hour locations in the city.  I'm not so jazzed about all the driving this will entail and I have told her such.

She responded by getting mad at me and guilting me through the whole ""we haven't done anything in a year"" excuse.  I've pointed out to her that I'm not against going, I just don't want to always be the designated chauffeur, so to speak.  She just repeats that she hates driving and that she's not comfortable driving for that kind of distance.  I've offered to drive halfway and have her take over the second half of the trip, but she refuses.

Reddit, please, would I be the asshole if I put my foot down and insisted that my partner take on some of the driving responsibilities despite her insistence that it makes her very uncomfortable?  I really don't want to seriously damage our relationship over something so small, but I'm honestly so tired of being seemingly the one and only driver between us.",Not the A-hole,0
"My roommate and I are both females in our early 20s. My roommate, A, is very entitled and naive (yelled at her dad for not giving her the amount of graduation money she “deserved,” etc.). A is also very wasteful in the sense that she will have lights on in every room but only be in one, and doesn’t believe in recycling. For the most part I let her do her thing but I do turn off lights if no one is in the room and it’s clear she’s not coming right back and I keep my recyclables separate and take care of them myself. Recently A has been ordering a lot of clothes, a new package comes every week, and throwing her old ones out in the kitchen trash can.  At first I didn’t think anything of it, then I saw a pair of boots in the trash that she just got a few weeks ago and was very excited about. They’re in almost new condition and I asked her why she threw them out. Her response was simply that they were so cheap it didn’t matter and she got a new pair anyway. After that I started paying more attention to the clothes she was tossing and saw that they were all new-almost new and she was just…throwing them away. So I started taking them out of the trash (if they weren’t ruined or covered in trash) and donating them to goodwill. One day she asked were the clothes in the trash went and I told her that I took the ones in good condition and donated them instead of just throwing them away. She yelled at me and told me that I was stealing her clothes and that I’m disgusting. I told her she threw them away and I just didn’t want new clothes to go to waste when someone else could use them. My friends agree with me, but hey they’re my friends, but she thinks I’m TA. What are your thoughts Reddit?

Edit: For those of you concerned about the legality, we are both on the lease and hold the property as co-tenants.

"I'm a junior in college, living in a dorm with way too many people, tbh. I'm taking 16 units and working an on-campus work-study job that starts at 7:30 am five days a week. So, like, I need my sleep to function and manage all that. 

I have roommates who evidently do not require sleep. They stay up and talk and laugh in the room till 2 or 3 am usually, and it's always extremely loud. Like, not a quiet giggle here and there, but full-on guffawing into the wee hours of the morning. EVERY NIGHT. I usually go to sleep around 10/10:30, and after this time, I always ask them to be quiet so I can sleep. Every single time, this request is ignored. I wear earplugs and have even started putting earmuffs on top of these to drown out the sound, but it's just too loud.  

Last night, it was so bad (5 or 6 times of asking), I went outside and slept on the floor in the hallway because I was just sick of being constantly sleep-deprived (I can't function on 3-4 hours of sleep; I just physically can't). And oh, sweet jesus, it was quiet! Finally, I actually slept some! I got a LOT of snotty comments and looks over this because I guess they thought it was dramatic, but what am I supposed to do when they won't shut up after multiple requests?? Anyway, fast-forward to this morning, when I filed a noise complaint against them and management responded by sending out an email to the entire building (not the first, btw) saying there have been several complaints and to remind everyone that quiet hours are between 10pm - 8am every night so people can sleep. My roommates know it was me, and now we're not speaking. 

I asked multiple times every night for this to stop or for them to at least take it out to one of the common rooms, so it's not like this complaint came out of the blue. Hell, they even signed a roommate agreement about it. I'm just tired of it. I'm always super quiet when I get up and leave for work in the morning, but my roommates seem incapable of doing anything at all quietly and showing me that same level of courtesy.

"This is my first post to Reddit in general so the obligatory apologies for bad formatting, and English is indeed my first language etc. 
 

Background.
We have several animals in the household, including 3 dogs, and a cat. My dad has two red setters, quite big dogs kind you, and they're as clumsy as anything. They also get into moods of chasing the cat (not all the time, and I can normally spot when they're about to and prevent it). The last dog is a bichon and couldn't care less about the cat being anywhere near him. 
The cat hasn't been inside in years, she just doesn't like it but I always try and make sure she is happy and comfortable somewhere, if it can't be inside. She has a constant supply of food in our shed and an old dog kennel full of old carpet to sleep in if she wants. She hunts quite a bit and I'm not concerned about cars (I've seen her look both ways like we do). Problem is she's terrified of the big dogs, even if they're not chasing her. 

The Story.
The cat came inside tonight, and sat right next to me. It was as if the stars had aligned and I was the chosen one. She's never done this proactively, I happened to have a window open to let some air in because the room gets too hot when the stove is lit, and the bichon gets too warm. She was sat there for about 10 mins when my dad came in, saw the cat and was amazed for all of 30 seconds, when he said he was letting the big dogs in for the night and he walked out. I went after him and asked him to hold off for 10 or so more mins so I could have more time with the cat, but he looked me dead in the eye and opened the back door anyways. Long story short, the cat tore out the open window to get away from them and now I don't think she'll be back anytime soon. She always disappears when something scares her, and it's going to take ages to build that sort of trust with her again I'm betting.

I went to bed even though it was still really early, and I didn't make any effort to hide my anger, and now both of my parents are angry at me for this.

"Some background:


I (22M) work in customer support for an electronics sort of chain supermarkets, where I live (Not the US). My job consists of getting customers their wares, sending things to get repaired, returning wares and if within reason getting them a replacement. 


The AITA part:


I earlier last week had a customer come in with a very expensive item (think about the 1500$ range) and wanting to return it, it was within their right to do so. So I returned it, he asked me if we had a special TV in stock, which I checked and we did. Therefore I asked him if he wanted to talk to someone who knew more about it than I (a salesperson), but he was adamant he didn't want to talk to them, he wanted just this TV (3000$ range). Alright I thought, so I ran it through in my name, which I can and I am very allowed to do.

Shortly after I have done this, one of the guys from that department come down and ask me why I just returned Dave's sale? I told them, it was within his right, the TV isn't damaged and everything is there. So they start to argue with me in front of the customer, that I just upsold (I think it is called that, English is not my first language) that TV and should have send him down to them. I tried telling them, he didn't want to talk to them, but they didn't want to hear it, they just saw the sale (which was great on its own without accessories), because they were convinced they could pull more out of him, but they already had their shot and if he didn't want to talk to them after the first time with them, he probably had a bad experience last time and would have rather left.


Later I get asked if I even tried to sell him more, if I asked about all the extra things, which I did, but the second in command from that department was annoyed, that I had the sale and didn't care. That guy is great at selling, but he really is the stereotype salesperson, which is why I would get why the customer didn't want to go down there, I wouldn't either.


Some time later just before my shift ends, I saw they had changed the sale in the system to Dave, that sold the original TV, so I asked my boss if I had to take this standing, when I did all according to protocol. He saw both sides of it being they wanted to sell more and they maybe could have, but done is done and we already get next to nothing from provision, so I should get it, but talk to the storemanager about it to be safe (I got a dollar last month, and my colleague got 2, while the salespersons can get hundreds of dollars). 


I did, and even though he had the same opinion as the department, he said he would change it to me, but going forward should just send them down to the department. So I just wanted to know if AITA. I see their side, but I think it is just very selfish thinking, that they wouldn't get it in their bonus and I would, especially since a lot of them don't think we get bonus as well, so it would just be ""wasted"" on us.

ETA: I have exchanged TVs before, where they were ""bad"" sales, which cost the store more than it provided and for around the hundreds of dollars mark and was never told anything, but now it is suddenly bad.",Not the A-hole,0
"It's me again, let me take this opportunity to give an update from my last post. Firstly, I've been going off on my own a lot more, not been relying on my family to drive me around and will go for my learners permit next week. Been taking better care of the ferrets (let me know if there is a ferret tax), and saving money where I can.

Now for the issue at hand. I decided to treat myself to some food from a place me and my mother like, so I offered to buy her something too. She picked out what she wanted and unfortunately the restaurant didn't have what she wanted (veal and coca cola) so I got her chicken and sprite. When I tell her about the change she gets mad saying ""I'm tired of chicken!"" and ""I don't want Sprite!"" Thing is:

She never said she was tired of chicken

She said she wanted a soda, Coke is usually her go to but she has drank and enjoyed Sprite before

And she tells me she has a case of Dr. Pepper in the car she's too lazy to get.

I get angry, but I let it go and call up another place for her veal and coke, it was much more expensive there. As a side: It was pretty awkward that both delivery guys came at the same time. I bring the food to the kitchen and I tell her I got her veal and soda. She asks ""So you canceled the other order?"" To which I said no (It had what I originally wanted). She gets mad and says she doesn't want anything and storms off, going to sleep. Me, being very, very angry at this point take the veal downstairs and give it to my grandfather who thanked me.

When I started 8th grade my life became a living hell, all my friends stopped hanging out with me, I started to sh even more. I kept hearing all the other girls talk shit about my friend, but I didn't say anything.

&amp;#x200B;

About 2 weeks before school got out we were watching a movie, and somebody brought up something my friend did in 2nd grade, and one of the kids in my class was like ""oh yeah Hannah was so annoying I'm glad she left.""the thing is he's one of the kids that never gets in trouble, and nobody will stand up to him, because he will literally push you around, but I have several medical issues and know that if he touched me something'd happen. But I was never one to say anything so I think I shocked him when I told him ""yeah you're annoying to when are you leaving""

&amp;#x200B;

Next Monday I was still pretty pissed. Now that he knows I'll stand up to him he tries to annoy me on purpose. he was tapping his pencil on his desk and I asked him to stop, so he kept moving it closer and doing it louder, so I told him to stop or I was going to throw his pencil in the lockers (which are like 3 ft away) he didn't believe me, pretty much started tapping it in my face. Anyways his pencil went into the lockers. He was pissed :) He told on me one of the other boys told the teacher I told him to stop and that I would chuck his pencil into the lockers if he didn't. I didn't get in trouble and the teacher laughed. But when he went grab his pencil he hit my hand against the chair so my hand got slightly bruised.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to my dad picking me up. Went to hop in his truck and was having difficulty because I wasn't grabbing the handle. He noticed and was like you know they put those there for a reason right? So I told him why my hand was sore and he was like I- why -you know what good job. My mom kinda was like why but now she's kinda like well I mean... he could use that sometimes. Fast forward to graduation. A bunch of the girls were talking shit again. I was tired of being quiet about it and pretty much started screaming at them. They called me bitchy, I told them ""no I'm fucking sick of this shit I've let you guys walk all over me for 9 years. I know the locker you made me clear out wasn't Marli's and I heard what you guys said about my g-button tube that was in it, THANKS Makayla for that btw. I should've know I couldn't trust you you've been like this for years. I went home and tried to end it all but I didn't want to, and you know who I called? I called Hannah so if you could just shut tf up that'd be great.""",Not the A-hole,0
"My son(7) is in second grade and has good grades overall, but this year he got a new german teacher and started failing his tests. i talked to the teacher and she said she's sorry but my son just doesnt have the necessary language skills and struggles with basic grammar. i said ok, not every kid is good with languages, i got him a tutor. tutor said hes doing fairly well, but he still got bad grades. he got really frustrated sometimes and told me the teacher was reducing points on his tests for small mistakes that she lets his classmates slide. and ok, kids lie about bad grades but i wanted to double check and asked the teacher to show me my sons tests. 

She sad sure she can do that, but politely added that it has to go through administration and it would look bad on her as a new teacher, could we please try to improve his grades in a different way first. i said i did try with hiring a tutor, and unless she can give me a better reason than ""no language skills"" i still would like to see the tests. she couldnt so she started filling out the papers but was visibly angry, and when another teacher came into the office, she immediatelly told him whats happening, clearly expecting him to defend her. he did, saying this could be real bad for a new teachers reputation, but he didnt push and i filed the request.

Now i think i might have became one of those parents and maybe i could have given the teachers request some thought.
AITA for pushing through with the paperwork at the teachers expense?

EDIT 1 cause this has been asked: its not forbidden to see his tests for parents, but i requested to see all of them from this school year (now nearly 10 months worth of tests), which requires some paperwork beforehand because they are kept in a separate place, together for the whole school. its the same with other schools around here too (we are not in the US).

EDIT 2: he does bring home his tests after they are graded, but he needs to give them back the very next day. i tried to review his tests myself, but im not very good with german, and didnt think to snap a picture so i could show it to his tutor, that's on me. I guess i was expecting more improvement from the tutoring and i sadly didnt pay as much attention to the issue until now as it warranted, and now i want to give all of the tests to his tutor to review.

The request looks bad on her because i think there was an issue with a new teacher's grading recently, so me double checking another new teacher makes her looks suspicious. this is just the feeling i got tho.

Also, my son is learning german because it's required by the school system, it's not his first language.

And by ""german teacher"" i obv mean the teacher who teaches him german, not a teacher who is german lol

EDIT 3: he voluntarily takes the english ""fun and games while conversing in english"" class because he likes it and his friends go too, and it's not graded. Im not pushing him into more classes than required by the state.",Not the A-hole,0
"My girlfriend is making me feel fucking insane right now so I need a reality check ASAP.before I explode.

My girlfriend came over to dinner at my apartment tonight and we ordered Thai. When we got it, there was a curry dish that neither of us ordered. I double checked the receipt and I wasn't charged for it so I was like ""sweet free food."" She told me I should call the restaurant and I said ""fuck that. their fuck-up, why should I spend a second thinking about it?"" and she said that the curry could be for someone else's and that they could fix the mistake if I called. I told her she was being ridiculous and that if someone didn't get their fucking curry, they could call the restaurant themselves and that it wasn't my problem. She got all pissy and said I had a MORAL OBLIGATION. I'm not kidding; those were the exact words she used: MORAL OBLIGATION to let the restaurant know. I told her that she had to be kidding but that if she wanted to call a restaurant, she was more than fucking welcome to. She obviously didn't do that because WHO THE FUCK WOULD and just sulked, ate quickly, and left.

I think she's off her fucking rocker but I'm here to ask the ""moral philosophers"" on this sub if informing the restaurant about a fuckup is actually a moral obligation. Quick answers preferred because if i'm the asshole (which I sincerely doubt I am, obviously), I'll apologize.

UPDATE: last night while I was in the middle of writing another defensive comment here, i realized how pathetic i was being, arguing with strangers on the internet instead of actually being with my girl, who I love to death. i called her and apologized, told her she was right about the whole thing and that I acted like a complete dick. She said she was sorry and that she felt i had backed her into a corner with my initial reaction and that she was just being stubborn. we're both stubborn people so i completely get it. we laughed at the ""moral obligation"" comment and that was it. we're all good now.

"So this all happend some years ago, so things may be a little fuzzy. English is not my first language, and I'm trying to translate conversations.
First of, me and my sister is vegan, and we are both autistic with social anxiety. Social code is hard to grip at times, and I find it hard to understand unspoken social rules or predict reactions.

In my extended family there are several vegans, aspiring and veggies. Normally everyone makes a vegan dish for parties, or do a potluck. I don't, nor ever demanded vegan food nor except anything. I appreciate it tho, even if it's a fruit salad or a pudding cup.

My cousin and his gf(from now on BM-baby moma) was having a party for their 1y baby. On their invite they made a point of telling me and my sister there would be no vegan option. I thought this was fine, I understand she put together everything by herself and was stressed. (They had some real struggles)
My sis and BM was friends since years back, and the reason she met my cousin, so sis and BM did all the talking between them.

My sister and I talked it over and decided that we, and our SO's would just eat before and simply bring something easy and a dessert. Seemed simple enough.
Sis talked to BM, and she asked to know what we would bring for dessert. I was planning on making a small cake for us 4, and it would probably be enough for two others that are veggie aswell.
And shit went down.

They had bought an expensive costum tower birthday cake for the party. She was really upset that we planned on bringing a cake. I was accused of trying to overshadow their cake, and ""was just trying to brag"".
I am no baker and was in no way better than an average person at cakes, I don't know how I could overshadow any cake.

 We got told we could bring cupcakes(one each), we were like ""why"", and was told I could bring a cake, but no bigger than 4 inches(my cake was 8…). We said a 4 inch cake would hardly be enough for two.
She finally settle on allowing a cut up cake in pieces in containers.

The demands seemed petty and unwarranted to me. I thought I was helping out and making it easier for her, and I guess that is why I got upset.

Me and my sis was both confused and felt  insulted by it all. Sis also found out her husband wasn't invited, since BM didn't care for him.
Well my sis told BM she was hurt and didn't feel right with all the demands
We were informed that we disrespected their family and were no longer welcomed.

Me and my sis didn't really wanna go anymore, but we didn't want to fight. (again both autistic and social anxiety) they tried talking it out, and our aunt(BM's mil) even tried to mediate with our dad/aunt's brother. We hoped to calk it up to stress and let it go.(tho we wanted an apology or backtracking)
She ended up postponing the party a week. Nothing got fixed in a week and nobody in my family went in the end. 

Yes, it's all pretty ridiculous. 
In retrospect I should probably just have rolled my eyes and give in, be the bigger person ect.

So was I/we the AH?

EDIT. To be clear, she asked us to bring our own food. She just didn't like _what_ we were bringing 

TLDR
Hostess told us she wasn't making a vegan option and would have to bring our own food. When we told her what we would bring she got upset and started making demands on how and what we could bring.
It got a bit heated, we were upset and she uninvited us.",Not the A-hole,0
"I (24F) have been living with my dad and his gf for 2 years now. Overall we get along pretty well. My mom lives in another town and she has a mental disease. Long story short, my mom won't get any treatment/therapy so I just go to see her when I can and I try to spend time with her. I know she'll never get better and it's been difficult to deal with. I've been going to therapy for almost a year and I've gotten better at handling it but it's still hard. I've been dealing with this since I was like 20 but I've only started to speak about it more openly now that I go to therapy. My dad knows this and so does his GF.

I went to visit my mom this weekend. I love her with all my heart but it always takes a lot of emotional effort to do this. She has some type of schizophrenia, she hears things and she genuinely believes that people are after her. In her mind there are hackers, murderers and police trying to capture her. I can't explain in detail but I hope you get the idea. So spending time with my mom is difficult. It's like a deadly mission everyday for her. I have fun and we do things together but it still requires a lot of patience.

I came back today (sunday evening) and dad's GF asked if I was OK. I said yes. She immediately said ""and don't leave your room like that when you leave"". This isn't the first time I come back home and it's the first thing she tells me. And I just. Started crying in silence. I wanted to stop but couldn't. I cleaned up my room every single day for weeks. It was this one day because all my energy was for me to visit my mom because as I said it's emotionally hard. I really don't think it's that important. Not more important than my own mental health at least. And I just barely got home, where I feel like I should be able to relax a bit. She just didn't give me a break, I didn't even spend 5 minutes home. So when she noticed I was crying I just said everything. I told her she could have waited for me to settle a bit before telling me, or just trust that I’d do it tomorrow morning (I was gonna do so). That what I'm doing is emotionally draining and that it's just this one day, that I just got here and should be able to relax at home. That I have to process that my mom will never get better and while I may look okay on the outside I'm fighting everyday on the inside. I told her all this and more but I tried to not hurt her and be careful with my words. But it looked like she was feeling bad anyway, even though my point was only that I needed a bit more patience and sensibility. I told her I don't want her to feel bad, just to consider how hard it can be for me. There was a lot of tension before they went to sleep. I thought about apologizing but I didn't. I just don't feel sorry, it's how I felt and I was trying to communicate how she made me feel. But I don't know, maybe I was too sensible and dramatic. Or maybe she didn't understand me.

"So I hope this is going to be a short one. 


So basically in my family I am the one doing a lot of online orders for everyone. So like when my mother wants some baking stuff, she sends me the link and I buy it for her. 


On Christmas last month it got out of hands a little. Basically my parents started asking for a lot of stuff from random facebook ads they saw. I asked them to please verify that the page they are requesting the item from is legit. I told them that all they had to do was just googling ""Is page x a scam?"" or ""page X ratings"" or something like that so that we can be sure we are not getting scammed. I thought it would not be that hard and after a lot of arguing I was the one doing that in the end because every time I asked my parents to do it, they never done that or straight up refused. And its not like that they are seniors and only had a phone for 5 months, my father is 43, my mother is 44, and they do a lot of stuff with their phones.


So after an awful lot of ordering from random sites on Christmas I told them that I would not order from anywhere else than amazon or ebay anymore since they could not be bothered to help me in the ordering process. I use amazon and ebay on a regular basis, so I don't mind, and 90% of things they might want are still on there. So I thought this was a good deal. My parents could still order stuff and I would have less stress to deal with.


So now my parents started ordering stuff on their own from different sites. Every now and then I ask them if the site they are ordering from is secure, but I'm not doing it anymore since I told them I wouldn't. 


Then I get a call from my father, a few weeks after I enforced the new rule, that he has a problem with his order. So I look into the order and they tell him that they can not find his address. Turns out he typed in the wrong address. He asks me what to do and this is where I might be TA. After telling him that he might call someone from the site or delivery service, I also tell him that this is kinda his own fault for typing in the wrong address.

"This situation ended in a shouting match that I’m not proud of, but I was more than a little irked that my fiancé just explained to me how to plug a charger into a portable speaker. I typically let these “explanation sessions” go… I loathe conflict and he gets very defensive in any type of disagreement, but tonight I guess my overflow meter was at max level. 
Here’s what happened. I asked for a charging cord for a portable (very cheap dollar store type) speaker that my son had said he didn’t want any longer. I told him that the port looked like a “samsung type” of charger. I asked him if he knew where the bag of random chargers was located. He got me the bag and pulled out the charger and said “now, you have to make sure that you line up the charger and the port for it to go in.” 
I looked at him thinking that maybe he was making a joke but y’all he was dead serious. 
I tried to make a joke out of it while also pointing out that his explanation wasn’t necessary by saying “you know, I only had to take the shapes test in kindergarten 2 times; that’s how advanced I was…” and he got defensive. And I immediately regretted my comment. 
He states that because I have an iPhone I may not understand how to plug in a cord that isn’t an iPhone cord and he was only trying to help me out by telling me how to do it… 
Laughing may not have been the best response here, but I simply could not help myself. 
Through giggles I told him that he didn’t need to get butt hurt over me pointing out that I knew how to match shapes. 
That’s when the proverbial sh!t hit the fan. 
He started to yell “I’m not butt hurt, YOU are because I was trying to help you by telling you how to do it!” 
I yelled back, “it makes me feel incredibly stupid when you explain things to me that don’t need explained!” 
And he said “see, you’re butt hurt!” 
And like a child I slammed a drawer in frustration, and told him that 95% of his explanations I really don’t need. It truly drives me up a wall that most of our conversations revolve around him teaching me things. 
The disagreement ended in him telling me to shut up and not speak to him anymore and to go plug in my charger cause I don’t need his help. 
Am I wrong here? Is it my responsibility to protect his ego when he’s explaining something I already know? Bringing it up in the moment only causes a tantrum.
I know I’m not stupid, but does he think I am? And if he doesn’t think I’m stupid, why can’t I be trusted to plug in a freaking charger on my own?

Hey everyone, I (F20) have been struggling with bulimia since I was 14 years old. It started off as anorexia and I was sent to the psychiatric ward after passing out at school, it was obvious I wasn’t eating for a while. For the last year or so my recovery has been great, I gained a lot of weight though but at some point I stopped looking at the scale.

It was going great at first, she would share her milestones with me and go to the gym every day and make homemade meals, I was very happy for her. But for the last two months she’s gradually grown obsessed with watching the scale. She tells me that she only has a soup per day and walks 10k+ steps. She’s constantly texting me about weight and how much she’s losing, how many calories she’s consuming ( usually under 600 ) and how happy she is. I started to avoid her but it’s nearly impossible since she’s really close to me. It’s triggered my relapse, I can’t stop counting calories and stepping on the scale.

"I(f21) only dated my ex(m33) for about 5 months. 

He comes from quite a wealthy family. Lives in a big house, has lots of high tech all through it, nice car, nice pool, nice everything really, can afford to not work and still buy expensive things. The kind of life i could only ever dream about. 

I am a single mum of a toddler. I get about $800 a fortnight and rent alone is $500 a fortnight. We dont have much money but we have enough to get by, plus my parents are in my life and help out if we need it.

I never asked for anything from him but he liked to go out to dinner and do fun stuff with us so he'd graciously lend me the money with the agreement that i'd pay it back when i could.

Over time i started leaving some stuff at his house so that it was there for me when i was over and he did the same at my house plus would lend me tshirts, just as most couples do. He also is quite the handy man so if i needed something fixed he'd be more that willing to do that for me. So there is an item at his that he's fixed for me that is really important to me. My mum had it my whole life and shes now passed it down to me.

Now, him and i broke up about a month ago and i still owe him quite a bit of money. I told him the dates that i get paid and told him id pay him $50 each pay day. All up i owed him about $400.

I though everything was going fine. We were still chatting a lot and making sure eachother were doing ok. Everytime i paid him id send him a screenshot of it because he wasnt able to tell when money was put in his account (which kind of just puts into perspective how much money he has). 

Between my first and second pay day after we broke up, he asked if i needed to be reminded to do it. I was kind of offended because i had given him no reason to worry about me forgetting to pay but i brushed it off, he can be like that, and i explained that it wasnt needed cause ill get reminded everytime i get paid myself.

Well after my last payment i sent him the screenshot and told him id be coming up to the town he lives in so ill bring his stuff over and pick up mine. He proceeds to tell me that he thinks it would be a good idea for him to hold on to my stuff until ive paid back all of his money. I was completely taken aback and said that no, i was going to be coming to get my stuff and that if i didnt pay the money back, there were other ways of going about that, but i have the right to my stuff. But most importantly ive given him no reason to believe i wouldnt pay the money back. He said that he had just hoped i wouldve paid the money back by now. I told him that he knows my situation amd that $50 a fortnight is a lot for me. His response? ""I suggest in future don't allow your debts to raise that high"".

I didn't want to argue so I said I am going to leave for that week to my parents, will be driving to work from different city and they can do whatever they want here. Now my bf is pissed that I won't be there to welcome his mother.

"I (51 F) am visiting the old country in Europe where my parents (dad 80 and mum 77) own a house. I’m here with my dad because he needs some assistance with travelling and my mum can no longer travel due to a chronic and progressive condition.
Before I left, I offered to go through mums things and check a luggage filled with some nice clothes that she misses and donate some that no longer fit. I promised her that she would have the final say on what comes and what goes and I took pictures and got her approval for what to bring. The clothes I set aside are XXL clothes that no longer fit (her illness caused her to lose a massive amount of weight) and are in nearly new condition. Clothes that she wouldn’t wear in the states (too light and geared for more warmer climates).
The problem is with my dad, he’s been complaining loudly about the clothes to my mum and their dynamic is to gang up on me. I wish I never offered! I think it has more to do with facing their mortality rather than clothes! But my rational mind thinks earthquake and flood victims could use these. My mum will never return here, and these clothes are specific to this region and no longer fit her.

"I M(24) have a girlfriend Dahlia F(36) we have been dating around 4 months so we both agreed its a decent time to meet my parents for dinner.  Dahlia has a really cool style, but to some people it could be considered, ""out-there"". Although I adore it, when Dahlia was getting ready for tonight she decided to wear some sort of anime cosplay mixed with an emo influence. I thought she looked amazing but we were going to a semi fancy restaurant and my parents are EXTREMELY conservative and religious. I then told her she looked great but then continued to ask "" could you please change just for dinner? I love your style and you but my parents are really judgemental and i'm not sure the restaurant allows outfits like that"" She then told me I was suppressing her creative outlet and trying to change her. That kinda hurt me because I never wanted to offend her. I then asked her again, ""Dahlia please just this once"". She then refused, my main issue is I come from a culture that is very conservative and arranged marriages are common so I worry if they see her outfit they'll be more inclined to force me into one. I told her that and she called me backwards.

"I (24F) recently had my grandma pass away. She didn’t always treat my family the best and was very emotionally abusive and manipulative when I was growing up. I distanced myself from her, but I was never able to completely cut her out of my life, because my mom always kept her in our lives. My grandma was a single mother, and my mom was an only child, she never knew her dad.

My grandma was a massive hoarder and when she died her house was a complete disaster, she left my mom to deal with it. It’s like her last middle finger to our family because it’s taken months to get a handle on it. Family has flown in to help clean the house as well as friends. The house has been sold and my parents have until 12/2 to get the house cleaned out. 

I’ve been trying to keep my distance from all of it. I never really got along with my grandma, she traumatized me a lot growing up and at one point even told me not to come to her funeral. 

My parents and other family members have been calling me selfish for not doing my part, but my boyfriend says I’m doing the right thing by putting my own mental health and needs first.

"My husband leaves for work before my 1 year old and I wake up. On a few occasions he's left the back door unlocked after letting our dog out in the morning. I woke up this morning to discover that the back door was unlocked again. He said sorry but I told him I need more than that, like taking steps to make sure it doesn't happen again. This upset him and now it's turned into an argument.

This may bother me more than the average person as I have OCD and need the doors locked. I always keep them locked when I'm home, especially when I'm sleeping, and check the doors many times before going to sleep at night.

His arguments:
- it wasn't on purpose and he said sorry 
- we just moved to this house 5 months ago and it takes a while to form habits due to his adhd (side note: he did do this at our old place up until we moved, although not as frequently)
- house break-ins are rare
- we live in a good neighbourhood
- I've left his car unlocked on multiple occasions and he didn't say anything

ETA: Some are focusing on my OCD as the main reason for needing the doors locked but I just wanted to clarify that general safety concerns are the main reason. The OCD just adds another level to my concern which I guess is making me wonder if I'm overreacting and, therefore, TA.

ETA: Thanks everyone for the thoughtful responses and suggestions! I'll discuss some of the strategies with my husband.

ETA: Some want to know how many times. I've commented at least 3 in the last 5 months. I wasn't keeping count but I remember pointing out last time that it wasn't the first time so at least 3. I threw that frequency out off the cuff as that's how long we've lived here but some are so focused on that to the point of doing the math. I figure if we want to be that specific I should also mention he was on leave for the first 2 months of us living here and has had to go out of town for work for various stretches, so it's more like over 2-3 months.

ETA: Some think I omitted information about when it was brought up on purpose. If that was the case I wouldn't have mentioned it in my comments. I'll clarify here for everyone:
I initially texted ""you left the back door unlocked"". He texted back ""whoops sorry"".
When he came home for his lunch break there was no animosity and we interacted as usual. It came up and I told him that it was upsetting for me. He said he was sorry but I told him I needed more than that, like steps he could take to make sure it doesn't happen again. He made the arguments mentioned above. I thought it would be a quick ""sure next time I'll try x, y, z"" but it spiraled. Some are assuming I freaked out on him but I cannot stress enough how far from the truth this is. I was just looking for a solution moving forward. He admitted that I was calm and he got worked up.
We've since discussed it and I said in the future I won't bring up any issues on his lunch break. He said that was unnecessary, but that today he was tired and not in the right frame of mind, but that would have been the same after work as well. I do think a blanket ""wait til after work"" is a good rule of thumb moving forward regardless.

Hannah lives with her wife (Tina 35F) and their son (Ben 5). I was helping Hannah and Tina set the table while the kids played with Mike. I noticed a few cookies on the counter and asked Hannah if I could have one before dinner. She said of course. 

It tasted literally horrible. It had a bad contour and honestly, I'd say it was barely edible. I told Hannah she really should get rid of those cookies because they taste horrible. She shushed me and said Tina baked them with Ben every Thursday and Friday, and that Tina took off time from her busy schedule (she's a lawyer) to cook or bake something together so there was no way she would throw them out.

During dinner, we talked about how excellent of a cook Hannah is (she is a SAHM and is a greak cook). And I joked, saying Tina should probably stick to her career in her law firm because she is not nearly as good of a cook as a lawyer. The moment I said that I felt Hannah giving me the 'Shut up' look and Mike pinching my arm.

I don't really see the big deal with a small comment like that. Even Tina herself was like yes no one can be as great as Hannah when it comes to cooking this and that and etc. This is where I may be TA because I took it a step further and told Tina maybe she could buy cookies like a normal person who lacks culinary skills.

"I have custody of my 12 year old nephew Dex. My brother is Dex's dad. He and Dex's mom divorced when Dex was 2 and when Dex was 4 he met his current wife Shanna. When Dex was 6 his mom died. A couple of years later Shanna got pregnant and went into premature labor. My niece was stillborn and a hysterectomy had to be performed to save Shanna's life after serious complications. It broke her. She was lost and in her grief she attempted to cling extra hard to Dex and have him be the child she could no longer have biologically. But Dex was not Shanna's biggest fan and he did not want to just sit with her all the time and pretend she was his mom. My brother decided Shanna should adopt Dex. He was so hard on Dex for wanting to hang out with friends or for being in his room instead of around Shanna. She became more and more possessive of Dex. My husband and I noticed and we stepped in to try and help but my brother became angry and kicked us out and told us we were not helping Shanna. For several months Dex was cut off from the rest of the family and went through a lot at home. In the end he had a huge outburst in school and CPS became involved and from there Dex was removed from my brother and placed with my husband and I. It was supposed to be temporary but my brother failed repeatedly to change how he treated Dex. At that point he was treating his son like he was the worst person in the world. Dex told me his dad called him evil after everything that happened with Shanna. He told him he'd hate him forever for not helping her when he could easily.

It seems Shanna eventually did seek help. My brother decided this was enough to get Dex back but CPS and the judge disagreed. He then cornered me at Christmas and told me that he deserved to be back in his son's life and we were punishing him for parenting decisions that many others would make it his shoes (meaning trying to force his kid to become his wife's kid to gloss over the loss of her own child and her ability to have a child in the future). I told him he didn't deserve to be a father after the way he treated his own child. I told him Dex should have always been at the forefront of his mind, that he never should have verbally mistreated him for not faking things for Shanna. I said as a husband he should have gotten her some real, professional help and he should have supported his son in saying he didn't want Shanna to become his new mom, instead of calling him evil, instead of telling him he was disgusted with him or comparing him to a historical figure who was responsible for the deaths of so many people (this actually happened on multiple occasions). I told him he should be ashamed of himself and leave Dex to live a happier and healthier life without him. My brother was furious. He attempted to confront me again at work. A friend of his actually told me I should have been more understanding and even if I'm angry, it was too harsh to say he didn't deserve to be a father.

"Me (27f) and my mum (58f) have a good-ish relationship, we get along and talk about everyday-stuff but rarely go beyond that. She is also really sensitive, so I tend to mind my words around her as she often takes things the wrong way (not just with me but everyone) and sometimes makes a scene about it and I want to avoid that. She also asks a lot of questions, everything that pops in her mind she will ask and sometimes they can be a bit intruding. I am the opposite, having the mindset that if people want to tell me things they will, especially the things that aren’t my business to know.

So a few weeks ago I was going to a bachelorette party to one of my friends, Naomi. She and I aren’t really close, we are in the same friend group but rarely talk one on one. A few days prior there was a question whether the bachelorette party could happen because Naomi has been sick for a while. I didn’t have more information than that, again because it’s not my business and if she wanted to tell me more she would have. I talked to my mum about it and she asked me all kinds of questions about the sickness, which I didn’t know the answer to. Eventually I said jokingly ""I’m not as curious as you"", which she took completely the wrong way. I tried to explain to her what I meant and eventually the conversation was dropped.

The other day I was having dinner with her, my aunt, my aunts bf and my cousin. I can’t remember what we talked about but at some point she said ""it must be horrible to have such a curious mum"", referring to what I said in the prior conversation.

"I’ll just get right into it. I (29F) live with a couple, Jake (31m) and Kayla(28F), and another single person, Cory(32m). Cory won’t be discussed much as he isn’t part of the issue. 

First off, Kayla and Jake have 2 cats. One is elderly and doesn’t always use the litter box properly. We also all share a washer and dryer, and we have an agreement where if someone has to leave the house while their clothes are drying and another housemate needs the dryer, that they wait til the cycle finishes and then put the clothes in our laundry bag and hang it on the stair railing next to the dryer so the cat won’t pee on them. This all worked out fine for 4 months until Jake started getting lazy and putting clothes in a basket on the ground. The first time it happened, no damage was done and I asked them both if they needed to change the laundry rules or if our current arrangement was inconvenient- both said no, Jake was just in a rush and not thinking. The second time, also no damage, but I told them that it could not happen again, and that if their cat peed on my clothes that they would be responsible for cleaning or replacing them to my satisfaction (they are a little nose-blind to cat smells). They agreed. 

The third time, the cat peed multiple times in my laundry. I was MAD. I went up to them in the living room and told them that they could have my clothes replaced within a month or cleaned properly within a week. They laughed and Jake told me to add it to his tab (they owe me quite a bit of money, and to their credit they always make payments on time and in full). That’s when I snapped. It just felt like a blatant lack or respect. I told them that they were fucking irresponsible, inconsiderate assholes who couldn’t be bothered to move laundry one more foot to prevent it from being ruined, and that if it went on his “tab” that I would expect him to pay me back in full for the whole “tab” by month end.

"So, my (38M) daughter (12) often has sleepovers throughout the summer. Honestly, we’re kind of that house anyway. I feel there’s always some kids over, even just to hang out during the day. I don’t mind. I’m a single dad, my daughter is an only child. So long as the kids are respectful and their parents are cool with it, let them raid the fridge and chill. 

My daughter met a new friend, a neighborhood girl that’s the same age as her. We’ll call her Monica. Monica’s parents are a little stricter, which I respect.

My daughter had another sleepover on the 4th. Monica was among the group. I took the girls to watch some fireworks then took them home and left them to do whatever. Around 9, I heard some bickering and headed into the den where they were. Monica said she wanted to go to bed. The other girls kept saying they weren’t tired. They honestly stay up pretty late. Monica said she had a strict bedtime and liked to stick to it. I came up with the compromise that if Monica wanted to go to bed, she could sleep in my daughter’s room (the girls usually sleep in the living room) while the rest had fun. Monica was clearly a little disappointed that they weren’t going to stop the fun for her but agreed. I went back to what I was doing.

A half hour later, I hear Monica storming downstairs and chastising the other girls because they were being too loud. My daughter said that it wasn’t fair to expect them to censor themselves. I tried to stay out of it but eventually went in there and asked to speak to my daughter privately. She said she wanted Monica to go home. I said alright, made Monica grab her stuff and walked her home. Monica was once again upset.

Monica’s parents are angry with me. They claim the girls should’ve just gone to bed early once. My daughter doesn’t even go to bed at 9 on school nights, let alone in the summer at a sleepover. I said it wasn’t fair to expect the girls to stop their fun or stay quiet. I suggested maybe Monica isn’t ready for sleepovers. This didn’t help. My daughter 
 does admit she didn’t tell Monica that they usually stay up pretty late, but also said she thought it was common knowledge that sleepovers are like that.

"I (21F) had a friend (21M). We weren’t close or anything but he was a good friend and we bonded over moving to another country for studying. A couple of weeks ago I posted on my snap about how I got fat/food shamed by my doordash deliverer. I ordered 1 pizza and 2 garlic breads for myself because I was having my monthly red waterfall and the doordasher commented “All this food for yourself little piggy?” In my mind I told him to look at his beer belly but in real life I just took my food and walked away. 

A little backstory. Back when I was 13 I was bulimic. It used to be so bad that I was put in a recovery centre. The past summer I lost 26 pounds and my mum was seriously worried again but I assured her that I wasn’t purging and just wasn’t used to the food in another country (where I study). 

My friend then messaged me saying “two pizzas is kinda crazy” and I told him to zip it and corrected him saying it was one pizza and two portions of 4 piece garlic bread. He still told me that’s “a lot for a girl” and I lost my appetite. 

At this point I was pissed at my friend and told him it was not okay to comment something like that with anyone. Now as I mentioned before, we’ve never been close we only kinda became friends when we were 20 so he knows nothing of my history with food. I was just pissed off by the comment because even if you didn’t know about someone’s history with food, you should never shame someone because of it. He called me a fat shit for eating that much and that’s when I told him that I used to be bulimic and that shut him up instantly. I told him that I knew he didn’t know that about me but still it’s never okay to shame someone for food or anything. He apologised and I do think it’s sincere but after that I just felt miserable. 

I momentarily relapsed and that’s when I decided to not message him until I was ready for any communication. My friends think that I did the right thing but I feel guilty for almost biting his head off. My pizza and garlic bread didn’t fully get eaten that night unfortunately because I had lost my appetite and just felt sick to my stomach.

"(English isn’t my first language so I’m sorry for any mistakes)

I (21F) and my best friend (22F) have known each other for 15 years now. We are both students studying in the same university and are both living in the same flat as roommates during our studies. 

A week ago she had her birthday party. It wasn’t anything big, just a few of our friends in a small get together at a bar that we all like to go to. 
Before the party I was getting ready at my girlfriend’s house when I got a text from one of my friends who was already at the bar. 
She texted me that T (don’t want to use his name) is there. I was shocked.

A little backstory on who he is. T (24M) used to be a person that used to be a close friend of me and my best friend.
At first everything between us was fine, but after some time he started to act very inappropriate towards me. As our friendship progressed he started to become more and more creepy when finally he SA’d me. 
It was a very traumatic moment of my life and my best friend knew all about it. We both never hung out with him again after that. 

After I found out that he was at the bar I called my best friend and asked her about it. 
Turns out that she and him have started to become friends again and she thought that her birthday would be a good place for all of us to reconnect. 
I was very angry and started to yell at her. She tried to tell me that he would apologize for what he has done, that he has changed and that I can’t just not go to her birthday.
I immediately hung up the phone and instead of going to the bar went straight to our apartment. She tried to call me throughout the next few hours but I didn’t answer any of it. 

She’s very mad at me for this and now our friend group is very divided. 
Some of them agree with me and say that I shouldn’t be forced to be in the same place as him, while others say that I shouldn’t judge him and that people can change. 

I don’t know if I overreacted… Maybe I should have gone to the birthday either way? 
It has been 4 years since the incident with T happened, so I feel conflicted if I’m allowed to be upset about her hanging out with him again when it happened so long ago….

"I (22F) have been avoiding my down syndrome uncle (46M) at recent family gatherings.

I have known my uncle my entire life. He lives with my grandparents and has always been at family gatherings. I've never had any issues with him until the last two or three years. 

Growing up, my family used to live very close to a lot of my extended family. Around the time I had turned 13, my family moved a couple hours away. We saw family a lot less often after the move, not on purpose of course, just life getting busier as people get older I guess. I'm in college now which makes it even more difficult. I really only see my extended family during the end of the year holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years). So I only really see my uncle then. 

I'm not sure when it exactly started, but my uncle has started to make comments about wanting to marry me. Specifically saying, ""marry you, marry you"". It makes me a little uncomfortable. I think what makes me more uncomfortable is that my dad always laughs about it and encourages him. This now happens every time I'm near my uncle, it feel like it's the only thing he'll say to me. This has now extended to me not wanting him to touch me. He has come up to me and put and arm around me or a hand on my shoulder while saying he wants to marry me. So I've just kind of been avoiding him during visits.

My mom took notice at Thanksgiving. My uncle is her younger brother, and she is fiercely protective of him. She confronted me in the car driving home (in front of all of my other siblings) asking why I avoid him. I told her essentially what I typed above. She and my Dad don't understand why that would make me uncomfortable. They have both said that it shouldn't bother me because he doesn't understand what he's saying, ""his mind is like a 5 year olds"" and ""he says stuff like that to everyone"". Which could be true, I haven't seen him interact with any of my female cousins in a while, but it doesn't change the fact that I still feel uncomfortable about the situation. 

I worry that my mom thinks I hate my uncle, and that kind of offends me. I've known him my entire life! I absolutely do not hate him, and I understand that he doesn't understand what he says most of the time. I told my mom that it's just something I'll deal with and get over, but I fear she thinks the worst of me.

Alex and I are very close. He lives on his own, but we meet up at least once a month for lunch, he’ll come visit me and I him, etc. I totally understand want him to have his own life. I have my own too. But still, I enjoy our time together.

The issue is, it seems whenever we do hang out, Cora always tags along. Don’t get me wrong, I love spending time with her. But it’s just weird that we can never have time just us. I have a younger son, Toby,  who’s also in a relationship. While I hang out with him and his boyfriend, I also get some one on one time with my son as well.

Recently, I invited both of my sons to lunch. I said I really wanted to just have some time with them as it hasn’t been that way. Toby showed up alone. Alex walked in with Cora. I tried to hide my disappointment. 

The lunch went fine, though Cora kept commandeering my son’s attention. So, I just sort of focused on Toby. I can tell he was equally annoyed. 

At one point, I went to go do the dishes. Alex and Toby were helping while Cora took a work call outside. I asked Alex why he brought her. He said she wanted to come. Even Toby was saying “Come on, bro. You can spend one afternoon away from her”. Alex got really defensive and said he and Cora were a package deal.

Cora ended up walking in when things were in the thick of it. Toby and Alex were arguing while I was trying to defuse. Cora picked up on what was going on and started crying, asking why I don’t like her. I said that’s not true, but it’s not healthy if they can’t do anything apart.

Alex and Cora ended up leaving. I got a lengthily text from Alex telling me that Cora is going to be around and I can’t expect to have alone time with anymore. 

I truly didn’t mean to hurt feelings. And maybe I’m just new to this whole thing and Toby was  a unique case. I don’t want to be one of those mother in laws, you know? So, AITA?",Not the A-hole,0

My ex-husband “B” (32M) and I (30F) have a 5-year-old daughter together. While our breakup was not amicable, we haven’t had many problems coparenting before.

B has been with his fiancé M (26) for about 2 years. He proposed to her around the same time they announced her pregnancy. M has been really good for B, from what I have seen the two have a pretty healthy relationship and she does well with our daughter. I actually really like M and we get along.

Two days ago, their son was born unexpectedly while M was only about 8 months pregnant. I can’t imagine what they are going through.

B called me today and asked if I could watch our daughter for his week because with the baby in the NICU right now he and M are struggling to manage, and that he doesn’t want our daughter to see him, M, and the baby in their current state.

I thought about it and eventually told him that I can’t do the extra week because I have a travel thing for work that I can’t miss (I could reschedule but it would piss my boss off), in addition I said that it would not be fair of him to push our daughter to the side to favor his new family.

He begged me, saying that it wasn't like that and that he would make any compromise needed for me to take the extra week. I stood by what I said and suggested ways for him to make it work. He said that he wishes that I wouldn’t be such a bitch and work with him for once, before he hung up.

While I understand that B is going through a hard time right now, I do feel strongly that it is important that he maintains his relationship with our daughter, even when it is tough. Especially now, while the new baby is still in the hospital and being watched by nurses and doctors 24/7, I’m sure that he will be able to find a way to make it work... I can’t imagine that it will be much easier once the baby is home.

Anyways, I’m not doing this out of any resentment for B or M, as I love and care for them both. I just don’t want my daughter to suffer because of something that has nothing to do with her.  


edited for transparency - i miscalculated how long M was pregnant, she was at 32 weeks when she delivered, so technically she was 8 months pregnant, not 7.5, not that I think it will change many opinions.",Asshole,1
"Hi reddit, this might be a long story but ill try to keep it short. 

A few years ago my fiancé and I moved to his hometown. We wanted to save money and this town is a lot cheaper and we still have family close by if needed. We moved into an apartment complex and we didn’t really expect to make any friends as we’re both fairly introverted, but a neighbor talked to us immediately as we were moving our stuff into the apartment. Eventually we kept hanging out with the neighbor and he knew a lot of other people across the complex who my fiancé and I became friends with. We had a whole group to hang out with almost every weekend at the first guys apartment (ground floor). We spent our entire lease just hanging out and drinking with them and always hung out there. We came into the group later than most people, and we knew we weren’t the closest to everyone because of that. We first noticed this when they would make plans and not include us— which never really bothered us before since we were the new people to the group.

Fast forward a little, my fiancé and I had a baby. We moved to a new apartment but still keep in touch with most of the people from the group. Our wedding is later this year and we wanted to include some of this friend group as part of the wedding party and just invite them in general because we thought they are so cool and they’re our first friends in the town. 

We had a meetup recently and a couple announced their pregnancy to the group, and everyone was excited. As we all were hanging out the other people in the group started planning a birthday dinner for someone in the group, and they all were “counting heads” to see who is all going. They didn’t include myself or my fiancé and basically just avoided talking to us about going and never invited us at all. 

Normally I would just think that they’re all just closer or something but its been almost 2 years knowing them and this isn’t the first time they’ve done something major and not invited the two of us. I assumed maybe it was because we had a baby but the least they could do is ask, right? Even if we cant go. 

Especially with the wedding coming up, we feel like the people we thought were our friends aren’t really and they just basically humored us since we lived close. We both soured on the group after that interaction and just feel like we didn’t even have real friends to begin with. We don’t want to ruin our wedding let alone pay for people who apparently don’t think of us as friends. They’ve never showed any disdain towards us or called us out for bad behavior or anything so I really don’t know what we did to not be included in whole group gatherings. 

So, WIBTA if we just didn’t invite them anymore?",Not the A-hole,0
"So, hi. I’m 16F and I have a weird name. I use a fake name on this account for privacy reasons and I won’t say my real name here either, but it’s pretty unheard of. Like, I can almost guarantee you don’t know anyone with that name and you’ve never heard of it either. 

And the problem isn’t even that it’s a weird name, it’s that it’s spelled weird too. No one can ever say it. Attendance on the first day of school or when there’s a sub is always so awkward. It’s a never ending game of either constantly correcting people or being called the wrong name. 

I’m Irish, and my parents really wanted a name that reflects that. I get it, really, I do. But I want to change my name. Not legally or anything, just pick out a different, easier one. I hear you screaming “just go by a nickname” well, unfortunately, my name also makes that impossible. And, unluckily enough, I have a freak middle name too. I hate it. 

But next year, I’m going to a new school where I know no one. I just want to start fresh and pick a normal name that no one thinks twice about. My mom didn’t like the idea, but come on, her name is as basic as they come. And lots of people don’t go by their real names. Christopher becomes Chris, Gabrielle becomes Gabby, Lillian becomes Lily, you get it. Even celebrities change their names. So why can’t I do it? 

My mom insists that she and my dad spent a lot of time picking it out. But it’s just not fair. It’s not her name, it’s mine. It’s me that gets embarrassed when meeting new people because I get a double take when I tell them my name. It’s me that always has her name spelled wrong on everything. It’s my struggle, so I think I should be able to come up with my own solution for it. AITA?

Edit: for clarification, I live in the US. Both my parents are Irish (more so my father) and would someday like to live in Ireland. I’m Ireland the name would be more common, but it’s unheard of in the US. The spelling is the traditional Gaelic spelling. To reiterate, it’s not really a name that could be condensed into a nickname, so I would have to pick a different name. And I wouldn’t change it legally, at least not yet. Also, I’m sorry if I insulted anyone with an Irish name. The culture and the names are beautiful, and I shouldn’t have used the word freak. I’ve just had a rough experience with my particular name.",Not the A-hole,0
"First let me explain that I have 2 big dogs (both roughly 65-70lb) that I let out every morning. I don’t let them run around the house because they eat plastic (2 kids with lots of plastic toys), terrorize the cat, etc. I have 2 acres so I let them run around a few hours in morning and in the evening until we go to bed. Other than that they are crated. I am not always ready to get them inside and crated. Our property is not fenced in but we have an electric grid with collars for the dogs. They know their boundary and I’ve never seen them cross it. It’s also good to add these dogs are big teddy bears and wouldn’t  hurt someone on purpose(maybe accidentally knock them over) even if they crossed the perimeter into our property. I do not have any beware of dog signs, but there are maybe 15 houses on the whole street so I know most of my neighbors and we are on a private road. 

This morning I’m inside with my kids and I hear screaming. Again 15 houses on the street and it’s mostly quiet. I look outside and I see an older lady, that I have never seen before, in the middle in the road screaming while my dogs are standing excitedly at the edge of their perimeter. I am not ready to have them inside because, 1 they don’t come in through the front (crates are next to the back door), 2 the cat is inside and they would chase him around the house. I go outside to coax them by me so she can walk past the house, but I don’t put them inside. The whole time she’s yelling that I shouldn’t let my dogs run freely and I need to put them inside or leash them. All I yelled was they don’t leave the property and I went back in. I have never seen that woman before and if you live there you would know I have dogs and that I have them out every day at that time. AITA because i didn’t bring in the dogs so she could feel safe walking by my house? My mom says I should have, and my husband said I shouldn’t have even gone outside at all.

That being said we are making the most compromises here, we are moving about 30-45 minutes away from work while he will be about 10-15 minutes away and that’s okay, my friends wife wants it to have large bathrooms, a fenced in back yard, be pet friendly (we don’t own pets ourselves but want to get back into keeping pet fish.) they have three animals so it’s understandable, but she also wants us to buy healthy foods while that’s fine we work 6 days a week and usually only eat once a day fast food if necessary since we work late, we are the ones buying the groceries as well, she also wants us to do a three way split on rent which leaves her husband only paying roughly 475 while we pay 950 and she also wants us to babysit their kid when necessary which is fine, we don’t have kids at home since my wife is divorced and it’s joint custody but that’s a whole other long story. She also insists that we do not buy any Tylenol etc. because they don’t do medicine on account of having a kid in the house while that’s fine they constantly leave their vape juice and vapes laying around which I’ve had to stop their kid from getting into as well as leaving alcohol bottles all over the house well in arms reach of the kid along with a few not so appropriate things for the kid to get into.

"I don't usually consider complaining and rating badly but this situation has me a bit riled up and I'm trying to see if I'm an asshole and that this is a miscommunication ordeal or its something worth complaining about.

I work in a building where a lot of the people order out for lunch to the point where the security in and surrounding the building have made it easier for food delivery to park for a short while in front of the building to deliver food to the employees inside. I was in a hurry today and ordered from a popular restaurant that delivers quickly to my place of work since we only get around 30ish minutes for lunch here and since I couldn't get food from home, I opted for that restaurant since they know the place so well.

The delivery guy calls and tells me he's outside and I go outside to the usual parking space that is designated to the food delivery, I dont spot him so I call again and ask him where he is - specifically asking if he's in the front where the food delivery parking is, he tells me he's behind the building, near another parking area. I figured it's just a minute to go from my spot to there, so I do so, waiting for a little while and searching before I call again to tell him I dont see him. I've been outside in 40c heat that feels like 50, alongside the high humidity, for at least 10 minutes trying to find him with no avail after his instructions from when he hung up.

I called him a third time, this time I asked him if he can come to the front of the building since I couldn't find him. Instead, he said he'll send me his location and I can come to him and then hung up. The parking place he was at was for an apartment building right beside my workplace. I called again and asked again if he could come to the front because the parking place was not the company's and it was another 5 minute walk to there alone.

He huffed and asked if I still cant find the location even though he sent it to me, I just said it'll be easier if he can just come by the front of building as I'll notice him better. Lo and behold, it takes him a grand total of 20 seconds to drive from that area to the designated parking space and I get my food. At first I thought he was new and maybe didnt know his way about this place, so I just mentioned how the front area of the building here allows food delivery in quickly for the sake of time management on both ends, he just tells me that I could have walked and I'm making his other deliveries late for not specifying from the get go, even though I think I clarified from the first call that the front of the building is quicker access.

WIBTA for complaining about his attitude and not listening to me? A part of me says do it since he wasted \~20 minutes of my lunch time, another part of me is saying it's a dick move and that I should have been clearer.

"Long-time viewer, first-time poster...

Some backstory:  I went to a private high school where most of the students were upper-middle-class.  My classmates' parents were business owners, doctors, bank presidents, etc...  My family would be considered lower-middle-class but because of decent grades and our state's voucher system, I received a scholarship to attend the last few years of high school at a private school.

Some of the kids at this high school fit the ""spoiled rich kid"" stereotype particularly well.  ie.  Gets an expensive new car for their 16th birthday, wrecks it 2 weeks later, gets a new one the next day because daddy is rich...  The majority of these students are actually very smart and really wonderful people, but there's a select few of them that are laughably poor decision-makers.  Just the kind of people to fall into a pyramid scheme.

I graduated more than 4 years ago and am pursuing a masters degree at a university that's several states away from where I went to high school.  For the most part, I haven't kept a relationship with any high school classmates, so I am pleasantly surprised when someone in my graduating class messages me on Facebook.  I check the message and it's, unfortunately, one of those copy and paste pyramid schemes.  ie.  ""I'm working at a new job and am excited to offer you something completely useless and irrelevant to your life...""  I hate getting these messages, but I love to see people post about how they wasted a pyramid schemer's time on r/antiMLM.

What bothers me about this is how little effort they have put into scamming people.  My profile explicitly says that I attend university several hours away from them, but they didn't even bother to check that before mass-messaging dozens of former classmates about their services.  So, my thought was that I'll tell them that I'm interested in hearing their sales pitch, but not tell them that I'm living in another state.  I'll waste as much time as possible, and when I can no longer keep stretching the truth, I'll reveal that I live too far away to be relevant to them.  In other words, I'll be telling them, ""If you want to waste my time, I'll waste yours"".  I'm not outright lying to them, I'm just not telling them the truth.

"A little background. I live 4 hours away from my parents and grandparents. I've never had a strong relationship with my family and try to avoid them as much as I can. My mom lives alone and got a cat in early April. She smokes like crazy eats like crap and has a bunch of health issues.

In early July my mom became critically ill with pneumonia and spent 2 months in the ICU and then another 3 weeks in rehab recovering. During that time I took her cat back to my home with me and took care of her. I drove to see my mom in the hospital/rehab center every weekend or every other weekend for the whole summer. She got released from the rehab center at the end of September and she told me not to bring her cat back because it would be too overwhelming for her first day back at home. So I came back to see her when she got released. I was the only one of my siblings to come back, my dad was busy at work, and my grandparents didn't come by to see her at all. I was the only one there that whole weekend she was released, and let me tell ya she was not ready to be released. She could barely walk, she couldn't shower by herself, she couldn't get off the toilet by herself, get out of bed on her own, it was a disaster. I bought her a bunch of rehab equipment and installed it all for her, bought her groceries, cooked her meals for the week, took care of her, cleaned up after her when she couldn't make it to the bathroom, etc. And she treated me like absolute shit the entire time. She constantly yelled at me, never said thank you, absolutely no ounce of gratitude for taking care of her or her cat the whole summer. Whenever I was getting ready to leave to go back to my home she wouldn't even hug me goodbye or tell me she loved me.

So I left and called her mom and told her that I thought she needed to be in the rehab center another 2 weeks and that I was really worried about her living alone in her current state. This caused a bad fight between my mom and grandparents. My grandma called me and yelled at me. Then my dad called me to tell me how I was a bad son and how he was disappointed in me. Then my mom texted me and only said ""you suck""

At this point I just couldn't take it anymore. I did everything I could to be a good son and everyone in my family was treating me like garbage.

I have science class with a kid named Jeff. I was pretty nice to him and we have a few mutual friends together and the same interests, but before we knew any of that, I barely knew his name and that  we have class together before he started to act like we we're best friends. He was friend requesting me on Facebook, bringing tech for me to fix, acting really clingy, etc. Keep in mind that we had only been ""friends"" with each other for for a 2 weeks tops.

Fast forward a couple weeks, our science teacher assigned a group project. We could choose our group. My group was assemble, and Jeff wasn't there that day. The day he was there, he begged the teacher to be in my group (which was already beyond maximum capacity). All he did was sit on his phone for the allotted class time and outside class time we used to work on it. The entire final project for the term (which was the deciding factor for an A or a D). Fell on me.

A couple weeks went by and he kept asking the teacher if I could take him to the counseling office because he was sad about his aunt who passed away. I had nothing to do with that.

 I later found out he was just trying to get out of class because his Aunt had died well over a year ago. Just to confirm this, he would ask to go to the bathroom or the nurse's office because his arm hurts (when it would mysteriously be better outside of class), then we would just sit outside the bathrooms on his phone until the last few minutes of class.
 
Last night I decided I had enough when he added me to a 28 person Facebook chat. I looked through the people in it, I only somewhat knew 2 people in it. After talking with some people in the group, it seems like he was thought it would be funny to add a group of random people.

"Happened a few months back, we dated for 2 1/2 years got engaged, I was getting out of the military and decided to stay in the area because it was close to her parents and career. So I bought a house with my gi bill, she was paying the utilities. About three months into the engagement she mentions that shes been thinking about not wanting kids. We had discusses everything before we got engaged so I was a little shocked. We decided to see a relationship counselor to figure it out. I got busy with work and school and never got around to finding one myself.
We went on a trip to see my parents and after that it seems like she starts compartmentalizing herself from me, wasn't really sure to do because I didn't know anyone in the area besides her and her family so I just hoped she would figure it out and maybe it was just pre marriage jitters. We sit down and talk one day and she tells me she doesn't want kids, and brings up a slew of relationship problems she has with me that she never told me before. 
I tell her she has to figure out if she wants to stay engaged or break it off, she says she wants to break it off. I went out on a walk to figure it out in my head because I cannot believe what just happened. I got angry and went back to the house almost shaking, tell her she has to figure it out now. She says she wants to break it off so I told her to ""Get her shit, get the fuck out my house I don't want to talk to you again"" She had two weeks and move out while I'm not home.

A pulls me aside and explains what had been going on. C has been really rude lately (saying she is fat, mean, and doesnt really care about him.) AND HE HAS BEEN HAVING SEX IN MY AUNTS' HOUSE. E (not A) caught them full blown in the act on the couch! Even though they EXPLICITLY told him NOT to. ""Not his house, not his nest.""
So he drives up, and I go to answer the door, a little disappointed in what I had just heard, but still happy to see him. 
GF is at the door first. She quietly shoves some bags into my arms, and walks off to sit down in the corner of the room, and sulks the whole night.
C comes in and we catch up real quick, then all settle down. He keeps muttering under his breath after everyone but me or GF speaks.
I ask E if I can go light up in the back with my mom real quick and order some pizza. ""No prob"" she says.
So after a bit, my cousin comes out, and asks me for a hit. 
I tell him no, and to go back inside. (He is 16, and isn't allowed to be out on the patio while we are smoking pot anyway, house rules.) 
So he tells me to duck myself, and asks my mom. She also says no.
Then this fucker grabs the joint out of MY MOTHER'S HAND, and calls her a cunt.
I was upset, so we went home early.
When we went to say our goodbyes, He forgot his bag inside, and told M to get it. Not asked, but, TOLD MY MOTHER. 
I said I'd get it because I wanted to say bye to the cat. 
As I was in there, I put a bottle of juice I had in my pocket in his bag next to where the joint was ""hidden"" (it was pretty obvious, and sticking out of a side pocket.) Then took a pic and sent it to his mom, asking if he's vaping again.

"The title sounds bad but hear me out. 

So my bf and I are long distance and I went to go see him in his student accom over Easter. There I met most of his friends, including V, a rather wholesome vegan. He wasn’t one of those crazy vegans that never shut up and tried to convert you but he definitely made it known on multiple occasions he’s vegan. Algd my bro, you do you, that’s all fine.

The accom was running a lot of Easter related events and one was a quiz, where if you got the question wrong you had to pick an egg from a bowl full of 50/50 raw and hard boiled, and crack it on your head. I was allowed to participate as a guest. 

V also decided to participate but was quite vocal, more vocal than normal, about how much he disagreed with it.

There was one point where it was just my bf and V up the front with the eggs. They were both shirtless and wearing jeans, so I took a photo on Snapchat captioning ‘Magic Mike XXS coming to theatres near you’. In the photo my bf had egg in his hair but V didn’t, and there’s actually no other evidence of what the event actually was in the photo.

I saved the photo, asked them both if they were algd with it which they were (though my sweet innocent bf didn’t understand the caption bless) but didn’t post or send it anywhere.

Now today.

It’s V’s birthday, so as per normal I did a fb post with just happy birthday you wholesome lad, and posted that photo. He messaged me saying thanks for the message but he was gonna delete the post cause ‘it’s not very vegan’ and he felt bad for participating. I didn’t respond. 

There’s a video from that same event of about 6 people, V, my bf and myself included, cracking eggs on their head posted to fb in which he was tagged and he put it on his timeline. He hasn’t removed that. 

I’m confused as to whether I was in the wrong cause yeah, it wasn’t a very vegan event but hardly anything in the photo highlighted what it was, and there’s still that video out there.

"Get ready, because this is a long one.

For reference, I sell body jewelry.  I’ve been doing so for about two years now.  I know everyone in the industry in the area now and there is exactly one shop I’ll go to BECAUSE of this incident.

I had my nipples pierced about a year and a half ago in a different local shop. I’d met the piercer in passing a little while before this and he came highly recommended by a friend. My piercer was out for health reasons, and I knew I wasn’t gonna do it if I didn’t do it that day, so I trusted my friend’s judgement and went to him.

He was very cocky and sarcastic through the whole process.  Not my favorite, but whatever.  First nipple went in fine.  In a moment of mid-piercing desperation, I asked him to put the second needle in before he did the jewelry for the first.  He smirked and said no.  Second was a lot more painful and came out crooked.  I normally taking pain pretty well but holy hell, that shit hurted.  I was really lightheaded and almost fainted; he put a cold washcloth on my forehead and said nothing, then left the room.

After about 10 minutes, he came back in and asked how I was doing.  I said I was fine and wanted to leave.  My friend that had recommended him was with me and wanted to get an opinion on a bump on her nose ring.  I threw on my shirt and went out to the waiting area.

After we got in the car, she told me that he had said I was a “pussy” and I should “get out of the industry” if I can’t handle such a “simple piercing”.  She’d known him for a couple years at this point and even she was shocked.  I cried a lot about his comments and my crooked piercing.  I still haven’t taken it out because it healed okay and I don’t wanna go through the trouble of getting it redone again.

While at work today, I had three women come in.  They were all quite friendly and one in particular was looking for jewelry.  She got her nose pierced by the same guy, who now works out of a different shop, and was having trouble with it.  I recommended jewelry for her and sent her to my guy to change it.  I also asked her how she liked him, she said she didn’t, and then asked why I had said that.  I paraphrased my story.  She wasn’t surprised.  She bought her stuff and left. 

While I had been telling the story, another woman had walked up and started looking at jewelry.  After the other people left, she said it was unprofessional of me to be badmouthing piercers and that she was going to call customer service to complain about me, (joke’s on her, we’re a tiny company.  My DM handles any complaints.). I told her that it was only my experience there, it wasn’t an unwarranted personal attack by any means.  She didn’t listen.  I already texted my DM and gave her a heads up, she’s heard the story before and is kinda indifferent on me repeating it as long as it’s not embellished or me bringing it up with no reason.

"Hello All,

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory:

So my MIL (late 50s) and FIL (early 60s) are both in a pretty tight financial situation. My FIL lost is job due to loss of sight in one eye (almost 2 years ago) and hasn't worked since, and my MIL recently had to have surgery that prevented her from working for 2 months. They are not in jobs that have benefits, so all this time off, they've gone into debt.

We are helping them re-mortgage their house and worked it out so that if the funds pay off my car, we can afford to pay the difference in the mortgage amount every month, so they will pay what they have been but all of their debt will be gone. However, re-mortgaging to pay their debt means they will no longer have line of credits or credit cards, the bank requires everything to be closed off.

MIL and FIL dont have a great relationship, more so a roommate type of living.

Problem:

My FIL smokes alot and likes to drink every now and then, likes to travel and buy name brand pricey things (he has always been like this) and refuses to get part time work to cover his own expenses. He gets about 200/month from the government as early retirement funds, they have no savings. My MIL is back to work full time and makes enough to cover the costs of living and a little extra. Neither of them have access to each others accounts and are not aware of what they spend but my MIL spends all her money on pay bills and debt and he spends his funds mostly on himself and his habits and have put them in debt.

Now he has ""offered"" to take care of all finances to relieve MIL of the duty saying that she doesn't know how to manage money (even though she has been for the past 35 years). I'm 99% sure he offered so he can swindle a bit of money for his needs as he wont have the credit cards anymore without her knowing. He told her he will take care of everything and she should ask him about anything. Things are a bit heated between them now and out of anger and frustration she agreed.

When I heard about this, I was in shock and pissed off, their kids aren't going to do much about it because they are totally unaware of the gas-lighting that goes on, which is why FIL thinks he can get away with this. I told my husband about this and that we will go over there and put all the bills on Autopay for them and set up a savings for her (since it's her money) and put him on a $200/month allowance. My hubby agreed ( since I need him to do the talking - I don't want to seem like a nosey daughter in law.

"So I’m a college student and I lived in a house with 5 others throughout the school year. At the beginning of the year, we got a cable package for the year and we all paid an even amount each month for it. At the beginning of May, a few of us left the house for the summer, but a few stayed at school over the summer. Those who are still in the house want those who left to continue paying for the cable bill. Their argument is that we all agreed to get cable, therefore, we all pay for it regardless of who’s using it. The cost of the cable, as they have said, remains the same regardless of who is using it, and so now that there are fewer people in the house, it costs more per person than it did before, and that’s not fair to them. Furthermore, it is common for students who leave for the summer to sublet their room in the house. However, I and the others who left were unable to find sub letters. They argue it’s our fault for not being able to fill the house back to its original 6 people, and that if we had successfully replaced ourselves, the cost would be the same as it was before. My argument, however, is that I’m not using it, nor do I want it anymore as I have no need for it. I’m not there and not contributing to the reason why we still have cable in the house, therefore, I shouldn’t be paying for it. If I had the option to, I would want to cancel the cable so that I don’t pay for it anymore. They, however, still want cable. That’s fine, but since they are the only ones who still want it, I feel like the cost should be split between them and them alone. Furthermore, I don’t think it’s fully my fault I don’t have a subletter. Just because I didn’t find someone to live in my room and also want to help pay for cable for the summer doesn’t mean I should still pay for something I don’t want/use, does it?

So reddit, AITA for not wanting to pay the cable bill?

Edit to add a tldr; long story short, I’m no longer living in a house that has cable, but am still being charged for said cable. Am I wrong to not want to pay it?


Edit 2:

Roommates and I have talked more and it’s become apparent the terms of our contract were not clear to everyone. Some (myself included obviously, as well as someone still in the house for the summer) believed it to be month-by-month, whereas in reality it’s a 2 year (couldn’t tell you why 2 years when we’re only living there for one) contract. However, I believe it is my responsibility to know the contract regardless of how it was communicated, and I can accept Reddit’s judgement that I am in fact TA. I will pay the bill, and make sure to be more careful with similar situations in the future

Final edit:

I appreciate you all calling me out, I needed the third party perspective. I understand the arguments and while I don’t like them I agree that I got myself into this. The main point of conflict was due to a misunderstanding in how the contract works, and because of how it works I can agree with the almost unanimous opinion you all gave me",Asshole,1

"My best friend Adam and I were not involved in each other’s lives a few years ago when I had a major falling out with one of our friends, Jaime. I explained everything to Adam and he took Jaime’s side. Adam was in a relationship at the time and he had turned into a real egotistical nightmare. He was cocky in front of his girlfriend and constantly berated me. I decided I’d had enough and didn’t want to be in a friendship group with a Jamie and an insufferable Adam

Six months later Adam came running back to me because Becky had cheated on him and left him for Jaime. I was sceptical about taking him back with open arms but I forgave him because he showed true remorse. We became closer than ever

We are still incredibly close despite living 50 miles away. Adam is going through a rough time as his mother is deteriorating with Huntington’s disease, he hasn’t have a job or a girlfriend in years 

He joined tinder. I warned him that he could get hurt again as the site is basically just a hookup sight and Adam falls for girls easily. He starts talking to a girl (Tilly) and they decide to go on a date. At this point I’ve been rushed to hospital with a kidney infection and suspected sepsis. I let him know what’s going on but he doesn’t even ask how I am as he’s more invested in this date

He texts me because Tilly wants to sleep with him (at this point Adam is a virgin) I tell him not to go through with it saying how he’ll regret his first time being a tinder one night stand. An hour later he texts me to say he’s lost his virginity

More recently he’s told me he’s not attracted to Tilly, calling her too big and “just a stepping stone” to more girls now he’d lost his virginity. I told him straight that he had to tell her how he felt before she got seriously hurt. Tilly was already calling Adam her boyfriend despite him requesting no labels and that this was her first serious relationship

On top of this Adam had started having an ego again, being particularly harsh with jabs made at his us (our mates) and generally acting like a horny teenager. He was becoming insufferable just like last time when I cut him out of my life

A group of us were playing video games and we invited Adam to play with us. He told us he had his priorities straight and was too busy having sex. Adam asked our friend Jack to write his personal statement for an apprenticeship he was going for and complained it was too short after Jack wrote over 1000 words

I’m unsure what to do. His birthday is next week and I’m supposed to travel back to our home town for it but I don’t know if he’s worth it to me anymore

He’s done this before, he’ll be an asshole until they break up but do I stick at it and wait to see if things get better or do I cut him out of my life. It’s worth noting I’ve tried talking to him about his behaviour and he denied it wholeheartedly. I could try and talk to him again but I don’t know if it’s worth it.

"GP = GrandparentS = SisterB = BrotherAny mention of $$ is AUD.

For context, my (20f) S (25f) has always been the favourite grandchild. My S was always the favourite any given time we had contact. She would be the one invited out to events, movies, daily outings, visits, gifts, etc. Whereas my siblings  would be stuck at home or stuck in their house daring not to touch any toys in fear of being yelled at.So that being said, there has always been some jealousy.

On another note, my family has always been ""poor"". We manage, but we've struggled for food on the table here and there. So when it comes to buying cars, they're cheap second hand cars. If one of us can afford to buy a newer second hand car, the original gets passed down to whoever needs a car at the time. We're a hand-me-down family.

Now for what happened..GP came back into our lives a few years ago and has been making serious amends with us, no more EP acts.She decided to go on holiday a while back and asked me to house sit for 3 months for her with the promise of compensation. I declined the compensation because I was happy to help family, but she insisted on paying me nonetheless.

Come payment time, I was given $800. GP asked me what I would use the money for, and so I said it was for my first car. GP sweetly put in a further $200 totaling up to $1000. I thanked GP with all my heart. This gave me the opportunity to buy my own first car! I was ecstatic!

At the same time, my B had bought a new car and was ready to hand his old one down, my S graciously offered to take it off his hands. This car was by far no lemon, its a perfectly good car, just not so great on fuel efficiency, and physically hurt my S with her illness. I didn't put my hand up for the car because I was already on the road to buying my own car.My GP understood this and didn't want my S to be in pain, so yesterday she offered to help buy my S a cheap car that would help with her health.Everyone was so happy for my S, GP is helping her get a new car that wont physically hurt her anymore. Its what we all wanted. I had no issue with it either, GP is practically buying both our cars, and whats a couple $k difference?

Well.. This morning I found out GP is going to spend $10k on my S's car.. What? I house sit for 3 months and get 1k but she gets a 10k car for just having an illness?? I understand its a life long illness, but this feels extreme.As I said, i understand if its like 4k+... but this is just absurd.I'm trying to calm myself by saying that its the best thing for her, we wont have to worry about fixing the car or poor fuel efficiency... But wow. Definitely rubs sand in the wound of jealously.

I really don't want to be a sour apple over this, I want some sense knocked into my head by strangers.

So, AITA for being jealous over my S's new car?

Edit:   
I just want to note, I'm not angry with my S or GP. I love them both.

I ended being adopted by two insane people who made my life miserable. I cut off contact with them once I went to university and have been relatively happier since.

I recently looked for my birth parents and was able to track them down.

They are actually married to each other and have three kids.

So this is what pissed me off. My siblings are 25, 20 and 16. I'm 23. Also, they seemed to come from rich families.

I messaged both of them on Facebook and they ended up meeting me. They were very clearly guilty and my birth mother ended up crying and said they gave me up because they were told I'd have mental disabilities growing up. And if they'd known, they wouldn't have given me up at all. Instead, they told everyone I died.

I was not able to accept this at all. It just made me angrier. I told them I'd tell everyone about how they abandoned me. Especially since they had the means to care for me.

This freaked them out because they had a lot to lose.

It suddenly devolved into a weird situation where first they paid off my study loans.

Then I started getting money every month to ""make up"" for the years I struggled. I never asked for any of this but I didn't stop them either.

After being told  what we had done we immediately took responsible, bought him a massive box of different craft beers as an initial apology and told him we would pay for the damage.

My friend and I asked if we could get it appraised and whatever the independent appraisal was we would then buy they sword off him so he could then replace the now ‘worthless’ Katana’.

We later find out that he wants to buy a more unique and rare sword, hence the $1400 price tag. Further more, he said he wants to keep the bow worthless sword. At this point things are getting less friendly. We begin to argue; we are firm that it needs to be independently appraised to find a fair and non-biased price. Long story short he tells us to pay $1400 or to go away. We stand our ground and say we are happy to pay for our mistake, but not based on a sword that isn’t in the same category or value. We state if we broke your 32” TV we wouldn’t be on the hook for a 60” TV. He yelled and screamed and basically we are at a stand still. Are we the ass holes?",Not the A-hole,0
"I own a 2 bedroom apartment and no roommates although my boyfriend is over most weekends. I sleep in the master and the other bedroom is used for storage and has a bed for an occasional visitor. I’m an introvert and couldn’t be happier with the setup. 

One of my friends, Shelley, lives in a city 45 minutes away. She has a Monday-Friday job but wants to make more money and found a weekend job in a city close to me. It’s an on call job where she would only go in when called and this could happen anytime day or night Saturday or Sunday and she’d have a small amount of time to commute. 

She knows I have an extra bedroom and asked if she could rent out that room on the weekends and pay me for it. I want to be able to help my friend if I can but I really don’t want to do this. I don’t want a roommate and that’s essentially what she would be. I’m not comfortable with someone coming and going all hours of the day or night and I want to be able to enjoy my weekends at my place with my boyfriend or other family and friends without someone always there. And I would hate to have to figure out arrangements if I ever wanted another visitor to stay in that room. Plus I want to be able to access that room whenever I want and not feel like I have to cater to her if she was sleeping. 

I told her I’d have to think about it and she went off on me saying how I’m being a bad friend and selfish since I have the bed anyway. The extra money from the job would help her and she doesn’t want to rent an apartment to only stay there on weekends. Plus I’d be getting paid and it’s only 2 days out of the week so what’s the problem? I said she’s asking a lot to come every weekend for an indefinite period of time and I need to think about it and she’d be coming in the only days I have off from work.

She said she had to go and we hung up and she sent a follow up text saying how hurt she is and she’s not asking a lot. 

Again I’m always willing to help my friends when I can and if she needed a place to crash for just 1 or 2 weekends, I’d be willing, but not for an indefinite period of time and I don’t want a roommate. But on the other hand, I do have the extra bed and I’d really be helping her out for the job, so I’m wondering AITA?",Not the A-hole,0
"I(20M) live with my dad (61) and stepmom (40). My dad doesn't have a steady income and gets paid per job. My stepmom meanwhile is on disability and therefore gets a fixed income from social security. I am a student working part time, and I plan to pay off a truck I am buying from a friend. I started making payments in December, and told him I would finish in March.

Last night my stepmom asked me if she could borrow my car because my dad would working late. I (reluctantly) said yes after she said she would be gone for just over an hour. She was gone until close to 11:30. She left around 7.
An hour after she got home, she came back into my room, and asked me if she could borrow $40 because her friend was at the casino and she wanted to go. I said sure, but all I have is a hundred dollar bill, and to just bring me the $60 in change back because it's the last of my money until I get paid and give me the other $40 when she had it. She hadn't asked me to borrow my car, I assumed my dad had come home sooner than expected and she was taking his van. Later I find out she took my car. I let it go because she has always been good about asking to borrow it and I let her borrow it earlier.

This morning, I get up and find out that she didn't come last night and slept at her friends house with my car because she didn't want to get pulled over (I have a headlight out). So my dad takes me to get my car, turns out now it has a flat tire. Not only that, but I also learned she disregarded what I said about the $60 and spent the entire $100. I was pissed about the money, but I didn't have class today so I wasn't super upset about the tire.. I just bought the tire a year and a half ago and I knew the warranty was still good, so I took it to the shop I got it from, told him what happened, and he said he would take care of it. I thought everything was done.

Then he called me saying she must've hit a pothole last night because she dented the rim and broke the seal on the tire, and that the warranty isn't going to cover it. He said he could fix it and give me a break on the tire but, best case scenario, I'm looking at minimum $200. I then told my dad all of this and he said I should just not fix it since I'm going to be getting rid of the car in two weeks and it would be a waste of my money. But I'm not just getting rid of it I'm giving it to my mother since she needs a vehicle.

So, a long story, and probably more than I needed share, but my question is: Would I be the asshole for asking my stepmom to pay for the repairs since she caused them? If I dish out $200 to fix this thing, then I won't be able to keep my word and give my friend my truck payment for this month. At the same time, I refuse to screw my mom over in this situation and make it her problem. I also know 100% that my father is going to argue that my stepmom shouldn't have to pay for the repairs because I can't be absolutely certain that she is the one who dented my rim, and it wasn't me.

"Recently due to a request from my girlfriend, I have started growing in a goatee ( can't grow a full beard unfortunately).  She loves it, I like it (makes me look older), and I have had a lot of people comment positively on it stating that I look a lot more mature with it.

Now everyone can have their own opinions, but my friend (F from here on out) hates it, and does t hesitate to let everyone know. I just went to break, and a coworker commented on how it was growing in and said he was a big fan. Well F immediately mentions how she doesnt like it. I, like I always do, said ""well good thing I can style myself however I like"". 

F wasn't a fan of this and went on about how some people can pull it off but I'm not one of those people and need to get rid of it. And mentions how a lot of people have apparently told her that I don't look good with it. 

This is in front of about 10 coworkers, most of whom I consider to be my friends. I was sick and tired of hearing her negatively comment on it all the time. And basically told her that I dont care how she falls about it, and that if she didnt stop trying to convince me to get rid of it and telling me she hates it  (Especially in front of our friends), that I would drop being friends with her. 

She started crying and left the group, and while no one said anything, I feel as tho some of the group disapproved and will be cold to me in the future.

TL:DR coworker constantly makes negative remarks on my facial hair in front of co workers.

Edit : thank you all for your input! I'm planning on apologizing for not waiting for a more private moment but that is all.

She texted me yesterday saying that she works the entire time now and she won’t be able to pick me up from the airport until she’s done work that day, meaning I’ll be there for 7 hours.

The teacher had these balloon holder things for a party she had a day before, so my friend picks it up and drops it about a foot off the ground to see how heavy it was, he dropped it and it made a weird plop noise. Turns out it’s weighed down by like 2 gallons of water at the bottom, so I pick it up and drop it and it plops again. 

He picks it up, drops it like 4 foot above the ground and it rips, water gushes out everywhere, the teacher was in the hallway, as class hadn’t started yet, in the end, the entire classroom was flooded with 2 inches of water. I go into the hallway and get the teacher, as she asks who did it, I told her it wasn’t me who broke it, and that it was my friend.

 We are in a server together so we interact pretty frequently. He recently turned 16, and up until the incident, seemed fairly mature. He is the youngest person in the server. For clarification, I am 25.
  
 Right after his birthday, I had made a joke that he was legal in certain countries, and made a bdsm joke (nothing super graphic or extreme) and he said no. I switched topics to joking about anime's and human experimentation. Kinda dark humor but it's normal for the server. He kept saying he wasn't into that and that he wouldn't allow that to happen to him. He never asked me to stop and I thought I had made it clear that I was no longer joking around with him.
  
He, and a few other people he roped into the situation, messaged my fiance to wake my SO up and didn't explain anything. This caused me and my fiance to have a fight, and I had a breakdown because of stress with this incident being my breaking point.
 
 I messaged the 16 year old telling him to next time, please message me first if he has a problem with me.  He taunted me for it,and I overheard him talking about me. I snapped and told him he was basically an insect to me at this point, and if he continues to act this way/ doesn't learn how to talk to people in these situations, he won't amount to anything in life.

"Background: Earlier, in the highscool 1st grade, i make a friend group which i enjoy to be together for a long time. we were playing LoL, cs go and stuff like that. it was pretty much thing for me those times. around the middle of 2nd grade, i felt like i've done nothing but playing games, sitting in class all day, talking nothing but games with friends. there were few things we do outside the school, eating wraps and going to a shitty game exposition. i tried to change my friends smoothly, w.out breaking hearts, which i failed. they were not open to new things those times. so i try to find new friends. i failed this too. i couldnt find ppl that i can hang with. most of them was real a.holes and the non a.holes were away from my reach. so i gave up my search and try to push my friends to be a little bit more active irl. it work a bit, we were going to the coast to ""play"" and going to drink sth(not alcohol!). it was better, but not the way i wanted. btw i gotta tell i wasnt so different from them, about being such a nerdy pussy. but i wasnt pleasured from this situation, tried to change sth, though i failed mostly. this continued until the early 4th grade.

we change our schools together. but i was really bored from them those times. in my perspective, we were doing actual nothing. there were only toxic jokes and meaningless, emptied conversations. one day they mock with my parents political aspect, my parents are conservative but im not, and they were doing this for years, since i tell them about my family. they were also mocking at me like im a conservative too and they do this despite they know im not one. i just couldnt stand it and walk away to class. they tried to make peace w me but i decided it already. i just didnt talk them, literally, which wasnt my intention at first, but it happened that way. i was friendless over a month. but i cut off my bonds with them in the end.

"This story starts a few months ago. Basically a good friend of mine was going down to Parris Island, South Carolina for Marine Corps boot camp. I was talking to a mutual friend who said she was going down in 3 months for the graduation. I have wanted to be a Marine since I was 6, and was very close to joining before I was medically disqualified. So, she knew how much I loved the Marine Corps and invited me to come along. A few days ago, she told me that they probably aren't going anymore because her mother is in the hospital and her car wouldn't fit everyone. So basically, she made it sound like the trip was off. She was apologizing, saying how she knew it meant a lot to me, but she just didn't feel right leaving her mom right now. I was more than understanding, was telling her she didn't need to apologize, just making sure she knew it wasn't her fault. When I was getting out of class today, I checked snapchat and on her story, she was in the car with the rest of the people who were going and was saying ""Roadtrip crew!""

"   For pistols at dawn. Well... maybe not. But almost. My Boyfriend’s best friend has been an asshole lately. BF hasn’t seen him for months and he barely texts or calls. BF had a birthday party for a major birthday this past Saturday and asshole best friend- henceforth known as ABF, who was supposed to come didn’t show, with no explanation. Today was BF's actual birthday and ABF texts “by the way happy birthday dude.” To which my response was eyes of flame. I am fuckin furious. Goddamn righteous anger is pouring in a waterfall from my mouth as I watch my gentle, kind, wonderful boyfriend, who would let himself get run over by a car if it meant not hurting someone's feelings, wilt. Not even a fuckin phone call from his supposed best friend.  
   My BF has picked this friend’s drunk ass up in a goddamn hurricane, has been his designated driver even when he's not invited out, driven him home from hours away in the middle of the night. He makes all the excuses in the world for him- but at this point, I’ve had enough.  
I ask BF to give me the dude’s number- I’d like to have a word with him. Bf protests- making more excuses on his behalf, but gives it to me.  
The following conversation ensues.   
**Me**: Hey \[ABF\], it's laurelynfaye \[BF\] gave me your number.

**ABF**: What's up (no question mark. Ass.) 

**Me**: I wanted to thank you for telling \[BF\] Happy Birthday. Since you couldn't make it to his party.

**ABF**: Okay, how's he doing?

**Me**: He's fine. He was hurt that you, someone he considers his best friend, couldn't come and neglected to let him know, but lots of others managed to make it. Even \[friend 1 ABF has issues with\] and \[friend 2 ABF doesn't like\], who he hasn't seen in years. \[BF\] was thrilled. He had a wonderful time. \[BF\] Forgives you, of course. Says you were probably busy. But me? Well. Let's just say I think you could be a better friend. And that \[BF\] deserves better from you. 

**ABF**: I told \[BF\] it was a maybe (BF says he confirmed his attendance, but maybe there was a misunderstanding, though I'm not inclined to think so.) Saturday was my one day back in Houston and I left. I'll be back for the weekend of Christmas then gone again. After that Next time, I'll be in Houston will be late March/ early April.

**Me**: So he said (in reference to ABF being busy.) And yet. He deserves better from you. He hasn't seen you in months. And before that for just as long. I have the right to be angry with you on his behalf. Treat him better. Get in touch more often. That's all I have to say. 

This is where the conversation ended. I think I was within my rights, and I was honest and forthright with my boyfriend about the conversation ABF and I were having. Part of it on my side is guilt because I think their relationship may have changed when BF and I became a couple, a year ago now. But I encourage BF to spend time with his friends, I was the one who talked him into a party, and due to living about 45 minutes from each other he sees them as much as or even more than he sees me. (We were close friends for a year and a half before we got together, and I know how important his friends are to him, ABF in particular, due to all the stories I've heard.)

The last time ABF even asked BF to hang out was 2 months ago, and he texted BF last minute on a Friday night to see if he wanted to go, right then, to Ren Camp for a whole weekend. BF was with me at the time, we were spending one of our rare nights together, and told ABF he couldn't as he was with me. ABF was less than pleased. Before that BF hadn't seen ABF since late July, in spite of BF inviting ABF out a number of times. The time in June was a party BF's brother was throwing and ABF got so drunk before BF ever got there, that ABF didn't recognize BF. I feel that this is unacceptable behavior for a friend and told him so. I'm starting to wonder if I was in the wrong though, with distance from the issue. AITA for calling him out?

"Long read and TYIA for reading.

A close friend (12 years) that initially was a mentor, and now a colleague, went through hard times.  Alcohol, gambling and not quite sure what else he was into.  Early in 2019 he called a small group of friends and told them, I am included in this group, that he was going to a detox facility and he was fired for something that he ""didn't do"".  After his alcohol detox it appeared that he was starting to get things together.  I asked why he was fired and he said that there are court proceedings pending and he couldn't talk about it.  I let it go but thought it was weird.  

  2 weeks later we met for lunch and while at lunch he ordered a beer.  I immediately told him that was not acceptable towards him getting healthy.  His response was ""It is only one small beer"". I again asked why he would have  court proceedings because of him getting fired.  (We work in financial services). He said that his former firm accused him of doing something he didn't do.  Again not a happy friend because of the beer I let this go and purposely didn't talk to him for a couple of weeks. 

 Forward to the end of the year.  Not being employed he has no source of income so he was forced to sell his house and most of his belongings.  He asked if he could stay at my home for a couple of nights and he would help me with things around the house.  I told him maybe for a night or two but my wife and I want our alone time.  He wasn't happy but understood.  

Over the last 2 weeks I have become very curious about the charges and situation that he got himself into so I started a Google search.  What I found is upsetting to me.  Again I work in the financial industry.  It appears that he may have taken a significant amount of money from a client.  Not only that, during the same time he was taking the money he went and purchased a few collector cars and was living it up.  I take what I do extremely seriously and am very careful who I fraternize with because of that.  This makes me extremely angry at him because I unfortunately can see him doing it based on how his lifestyle was at the time.  He was arrested some time in the last month, and was released from jail over the last week.  I found out the charges while he was in jail and am not sure if I can truly be friends with him anymore.  

When he got out of jail he texted me and said that he needs his friends more than ever because it was tough.  I plan on taking him to lunch and tell him if what I read is true I can't be friends with him anymore.

"A couple years ago, a close friend, Ashley, started a long-distance relationship with a guy, Chris. He has been really good to her and after meeting in person a few times, they decided to move in together. I was super happy for her as she had a few bad relationships over the years and it was nice to see her in a healthy one. That joy faded the last couple months before she moved a few states over to be with him.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue isn't her moving, but that she repeatedly joked about having a baby from Chris. At first, I accepted it as jokes, but over time I realized Ashley was serious.

&amp;#x200B;

For context, Ashley has two children from a previous previous relationship, ages 10 and 12. Chris absolutely doesn't want kids. He told her this at the start and anytime she hinted possibly wanting more, he shot it down, saying it was a deal breaker. Now, Chris is more than willing to accept her children as her own, because he loves her and after meeting her kids, them as well. He's accepted that they are a package deal with her, and since they are at an age where they are semi-independent, it's not an issue for him.

&amp;#x200B;

To me, Chris is a real bro for taking on her kids without issue. Hearing Ashley say she wants a baby out of him, ""one way or another"", bothered me to no end. It's hard enough to find a partner that treats you well and accepts children that aren't their own. To find one that does and then talk about plotting to force a baby seems gross and manipulative.

&amp;#x200B;

Before her move, I had sat down with Ashley, trying to talk sense into her. At first she resisted, but finally it seemed she understood how shitty it would be. After I felt like she had understood, I put the issue behind me and helped support her thru the hassle of moving.

&amp;#x200B;

A few days after she left, I got a call from a mutual friend who delves into the Wiccan/Metaphysical realm. She was distraught and confessed to me that shortly before Ashley's move, Ashley had come to her asking for a fertility spell. This friend didn't feel comfortable about it and refused. When pushed, she said she cast a spell for a healthy and honest relationship, but told Ashley it was for fertility.

&amp;#x200B;

As you can imagine, I was livid. I messaged Ashley, confronting her about what I learned and she laughed it off as she was desperate, but magic is fake anyway, so what's the harm? She then let it slip, that since Chris was planning on getting a vasectomy in a few months, she had poked holes in their condoms as a last ditch effort.

&amp;#x200B;

At that point, I couldn't stay silent. I gathered up screenshots of all the conversations over the last few months and sent them to Chris. He understandably freaked out and kicked her out. Now, Ashley hates me because she was kicked out after a huge move and didn't have a job or money to make it back. She said I'm a terrible person for putting her and her kids out on the street.

"Hello. I’m 37 and just found out I am pregnant for the first time. I’m about 7 weeks along. I have had the same best friend for 28 years. She is... a lot to deal with. She went from abusive relationship to abusive relationship and along the way had 4 beautiful boys. She moved across the country from me but I still went out to visit about once a year because I treat her boys like they are my nephews. I supported her as much as I could during that time, giving her money, letting her vent to me for hours and hours on the phone, sending birthday and Christmas presents. Along the way we have grown apart and although I know almost everything about her, she knows very little about me. She has lied to me so many times about having cancer, having a heart condition, having epilepsy, all kinds of horrible diseases. I worried about her and the kids constantly. I found out from her sister that she has been lying to me for years and is actually addicted to meth and possibly heroine. My therapist describes our relationship as “toxic” and it’s obvious my friend is attention-seeking and wants sympathy, but at this point, I feel like I cannot abandon her or her boys.

Fast forward to three years ago. She married an abusive man. I really hated him. She had one more son with him and it was a very difficult pregnancy and birth. She told me she ended up getting a hysterectomy. Her son has some special needs but is doing well. She and her abusive ex got a divorce and she has a new boyfriend.

I called to tell her my news about getting pregnant because I was so excited. She then told me that she is also 7 weeks pregnant. She doesn’t mention her past hysterectomy. She just goes on and on about how she will now have six kids and what a wonderful mom she is for being able to raise such a large family and how sexy and amazing her new bf is.

She told me on Thursday night that I hadn't given her enough notice, and since I was still on probation I would need to work the shift, or I was basically fired. I thought about it, and I was paying $20,000 to go to college, and this was a minimum wage job at a coffee shop. There was no way I was going to skip class so I could make doughnuts and coffee. So I told her I unfortunately quit then, and I left.

She was livid. She called my sister in to her office, and said since I was her brother, and I was screwing her over that my sister would have to cover my shift, despite it being her only day off, or she was going to be let go too. She reluctantly covered the shift, but called me afterwards and screamed my ear off about it. We didn't talk for months after this.

"I was friends with “Diana” since grade school where we had this teacher “Quin”, whom I was the only subject of berating, unfair treatment,, and a load of other BS since I was a 1st grader. She had many methods to single me out from urging my friends to turn against me, to love bombing my then closest friends, who included Diana. 

I emerged from that school with a lot of self esteem issues and pain and lost touch with everyone from there for a couple of years.

I decided to reconnect with Diana a while later and, through her, I got in touch with several other classmates from my old school, and also stumbled upon Quin's online profile.

I saw that as an opportunity to face my past in order to move on, so I wrote letters to everyone I've hurt/who hurt me to confront/apologize. Among those people to whom I wrote a letter was Quin. Seeing that Diana had Quin on her friends' list, I asked her to send my letter in order to protect my privacy.

Diana apologized and said she won't send it because it is “meant to hurt another person's feelings”. She then said that she hopes our rekindled friendship isn't affected by this.

I flipped out and told her that I'm not mad about her not sending the letter, but rather for why she won't.

I said of course our friendship is affected, especially that she has been there and witnessed me suffering at Quin's hands and this is her stand the end.

The letter was filled with sarcasm, I'll admit, but the words I wrote were well placed and well deserved, not out of malicious intent. I even wished the lady well at the end of the letter and clarified at more than one point in the message that I didn't send it to ruin her day or get back at her, but rather to confront her so that I can finally put everything behind me.

So if being confronted about her wrongdoings hurts Quin's feelings, then too bad.


Diana and I ended up arguing and eventually it just became me childishly sending vehemt texts and being left on seen, so in the end I deleted her contact and made a change of numbers a while later (unrelated to this), and haven't spoken to her since and do not plan to. AITA??


Edit: When Diana said she won't send the letter, I told her it's okay and she shouldn't ever send it even if she does change her mind later, but I'm upset about her speculation of my actions. I wasn't arguing with her in order to pressure her to change her mind and send the letter.",Asshole,1
"On Snapchat, we have a class group chat to share information/notes about the homework we have to complete over 2 weeks off from school.

At this point though, it’s become just a group chat to randomly talk/send memes.

The setting is 1 in the morning, I was pretty bored so I started roasting some of my classmates. I usually do this at school to my classmates in a joking way, and they understand it in a joking way.

So I roasted 3 of my classmates in the group chat and turned off my phone to go to sleep, then I get notification from one of the girls in the group chat I made fun of. 

I wasn’t trying to make anyone feel bad, but she was pissed. She texted me, called me a dick and said she will never talk to me ever again.

I still don’t understand why she feels like that. I didn’t expect her to take it seriously because nobody else does.

"I (33f) moved into an apartment in May with my kids (10f) and (11f). My neighbor (28f) and her kids (9f), (7f), (2f) come over everyday and it’s not just once or twice a day either. It’s six to ten times a day from 8 am to as late as 7 pm. 


My oldest daughter (11f) is currently dealing with some things emotionally and attends a PHP (partial hospitalization program) Monday-Friday from 11-3 to help her out. While being in this program she’s not allowed to play outside alone with the kids. Whenever they’ve played before it’s gotten physical or things have been said that aren’t appropriate. My daughter hasn’t always been the one to start this problem as kids are kids and they do and say things at times that aren’t always exactly nice. But each time it happens it ends with my oldest screaming at them and running off. The last time something happened she tried running off down the road because she was that upset. 


My youngest (10f) is limited with what she can do and for how long because of her medical issues. She has epilepsy that isn’t 100% controlled by medications and she recently had heart surgery and cannot be outside very long in the Texas heat. When they do go out to play it’s at the park where they can play at the splash pad and go for a walk. Unfortunately a lot of the equipment is too hot to play on right now or they’d be able to play at the playground as well. 


I’ve pulled the mom to the side multiple times and talked to her about why my kids can’t come outside. I’ve explained to the kids that they can’t either. Obviously I’m not telling them why but just they can’t. I’ve stopped answering the door because I’m tired of explaining over and over. 


I have tried getting together for park play dates in the late afternoon when the park isn’t so busy. It’s also the coolest time of the day where my youngest isn’t miserable and can do some moderate playing with others. She’s not really wanted to do this and has yelled at me for basically ignoring her kids. These kids play alone outside all day so she’s never outside. That’s the excuse she’s given me for not telling them to stop knocking on the door. 


AITA for ignoring my neighbors kids when they come to my door?


-added details-

When my kids played around the neighbors the few times they actually did they wear masks. Her kids did not and she’s refused to have them wear any at all. When I finally stopped all contact the neighbors had a massive family graduation party. That’s when I completely stopped contact with them. For those saying “there’s a crisis going on, you’re a horrible parent for that”. My oldest is forced around other kids five days a week because of the therapy services she needs. If I didn’t allow her into therapy five days a week she would be in a long term facility for the rest of the year. Yes, I guess I’m a terrible mom for not keeping my kids home 24/7. At least when my kids are out they’re safe. They wear masks, they wash their hands, they try to keep distance from others.",Not the A-hole,0
"Basically my brother and I have different dads. On my dad’s side of the family they are weird about bloodlines ect.. so they only accept me and 2 of my cousins as their actual grandchildren even though there are 5 of us. My great aunt was really adamant about that and after she passed my grandpa (her brother) was in charge of the money she left us. My mom calls its the “nieces club” because for the last 3 years I’ve gotten a $500 cheque(same with my 2 other blood related cousins) . I got 2 on birthdays and 1 for Christmas (this year). 

I didn’t know but my brother has only ever gotten 1 $500 cheque on his 18th birthday. (We are 9 years apart) and now he gets $50 same with my parents. I didn’t know until this year that everyone got less. I never bragged about the 500 but when my brother asked I told him. My mom told me not to tell him about it anymore because it’ll make him feel bad. (I’m sure it will, he’s never mentioned it but he doesn’t share his feelings much) I’ll be doing that from this year and will continue on as long as I get the cheques. I don’t want to make him feel bad but he always asks. 

The thing I’m wondering is if it’s bad I accept them. Like I know the reason I get them is awful but $500 is really helpful and I never bring it up unless prompted and now I lie about the amount so I won’t hurt or upset my brother.  My mom guilts me about it when I get them and has started hinting towards me not accepting them.

"I am currently a 20 year old college student who works at a fast food establishment. I am part time~20 hours and I texted my manager asking for next weekend off to go home. He responded back to me with “Damn you take a lot of time off”. I am not denying that I do, but I give appropriate notice for when I go back home and see my family. I would say I go back every other to every third weekend. Is this a lot, maybe, but it’s what I want to do. I was going to send a text back, but decided to hold off and wait. I’m only a part employee, most people who work there this is there full time job. IMO, they need to hire more people rather than overwork a smaller amount and then get pissed when something doesn’t happen. Would an appropriate response be “if this is an issue, perhaps I should revise my availability so it isn’t in the future”. This would pretty much make it harder for him to make the schedule, and he would lose a closer. Am I in the wrong here?

TLDR: am I the asshole for asking time off from my part time job too much?

She's saying I'm selfish and chose to hurt her like this just to be with bf. She saying that I choose to end ties with the family and insist on moving out and not caring about anyone's feeling. Never have I said about not caring them anymore. In fact, I kept telling her even after I move out, I'll still help out however I can. I've been the one paying for most of the bills at home for the last couple years.. But she's just not hearing it and even saying that once I move, I would not bother to come back to visit cause I have all the freedom I want. At one point she even said that she will make me and my boyfriend regret forever for doing this to her. And when I point out how most 30 year olds don't have to call their mom twice everyday when they are away, my mom yelled back saying then I don't have to call her if is so much to ask for. First of all, I was just stating it as a fact, I wasn't saying I dont want to call. And second, I told her if I really didn't call, I would never hear the end of it on top of dealing with her attitude. 

My sister and brother (both older) claimed that they understand me and agree with me, but have not even once stood up for me. They just cater to my mom, siding with her, thinking I'm selfish for doing this to her. I tried to reason with all of them that I'm just trying to live my life and gain new experiences. That I've always wanted to get out of this place (not because I hate them), but to venture out and find my own path for my future. But of course, they all twist it the wrong way and turn it into a negative thing.

And he barely have money saved up cause he keep spending it on expensive cars. The money he puts out is less than half of what I put for the bills.

Now basically, my family hates my boyfriend to the guts. My mom said he's not welcomed in the house anymore and she'll never see him as family even after we get married. She said that he manipulated me and is stealing me away from the family. And I'm being gaslighted, everything is my fault. I caused everyone to be so unhappy and created rifts with them.

"I am (26M).

When I was 21, I had a girlfriend and she cheated. It in turn caused me to emotionally turn to one of my best friends Tony (26M) as our other two best friends Heather (26) and Frank (26) were both in relationships (they still are) and I didn’t wanna see that. Anyway, my head was all over the place and Tony and I became involved (he is openly gay) He broke things off which devastated me about six months alter and it led to me having some serious sexuality doubts.

It took me a few more months to finally end things with my gf. I was nervous so before I dumped her I went to see my grandpa (85). I basically told him everything about my affair and how I was questioning my sexuality and it was disgusting. He basically revealed that he was homophobic, he started saying Tony was gonna burn in hell and that heather made the right choice by getting married to a guy (she’s bi) and that i Ioved my gf once and could again. I had to listen to this bullshit about him saying I could force myself to be straight. I was so disgusted that I cut ties wirh him.

I lied to my family for months about my absences around him. The truth eventually came out when Tony and I made a go of things and I told my whole family about us and my grandpa. Well, everyone was horrified and my grandma (83) was disgusted wirh him and basically moved out of her house to live wirh my mom and ended her 60 year marriage. 

I’m now finally out and still with Tony and the only family who really sees my grandpa is one of my cousins just as a sense of duty. She recently revealed in the years since, my grandpa has developed a range of health issues and that he’s probably slowly dying. A few relatives have decided to start visiting him and to put the past in the past and when they asked what I thought, I said I literally do not care about him or his health. He said some deeply hurtful things to me which made me cry a lot and it didn’t matter that he was in his 80s when he said it, he still said those things. It wasn’t just me he was disgusting about, but my friends too and I have no place for homophobia in my life.

I have since received messages from numerous cousins saying I’m an Ah For not letting it go for the sake of my grandpa who is dying and that I’m heartless for at least not caring a little bit that he’s ill.

"I am an 18F and I have a 15M brother. When I was born, my paternal grandfather opened up a college savings account for me, and it has a good amount of cash in it (it's a specific type of account, and I don't think they exist in my home state anymore). However, my grandfather did not do the same for my brother when he was born. I don't know why. It was possible that he simply didn't know that my brother exists, since my grandfather lived in another area of the country. My grandfather passed away several years ago, and my parents say that I need to split the money with my brother. 

I believe that the money in this account can only be used for college. My brother does not want to go to college, and even if he changes his mind, he doesn't have the grades to go (he could still get them up, but still). He is very rude and abrasive, and I don't want to give him anything. I know that sounds selfish, but I don't want to reward him for being horrible to me.

I'm paying for college myself, but my parents are paying for dorm stuff and books. I'm worried that they'll kick me out or pull any funding if I don't give my brother the money (they've threatened to kick me out numerous times, and I'd leave if I could afford it, but they wouldn't let me get a job). 

Like I said, I don't want to reward him for being awful to me. And I'm going to college, I've worked really hard. So, AITA for not wanting to give him my money.

"Gonna try my best to keep the writing neutral. My parents divorced when I was small, but mom gave birth to a younger brother a couple years after divorce. I started questioning where he came from when I was around 8, after I'd started noticing my mom and a close family friend (who is married with family) were weirdly close at times. Should've been an eye opener when I walked in on them making out (got yelled at for interrupting too) but younger me was in denial and probably was too scared to piece together the truth.

Fast forward to when I was 14, he was still coming to my house regularly and one night they go straight to my mom's room and are having sex very loudly. That's when my brain finally accepted that he was their kid and remembered the makeout session. Anyways that night I was more preoccupied on making sure my brother wasn't aware of what was happening (he's quite a bit younger than me), and when things got quiet I kind of stormed in and we started yelling, about what I can't remember clearly anymore. When he'd come over to our house I'd be hostile to them and then cry when I was alone. I felt betrayed and a little unwelcomed after I realised how I would always be locked out of my mom's room when everyone else was in there during his visits, even before things blew up.

 After a couple visits of me being rude my mom confronted me, saying that while she understood being upset about the sex, technically the situation wasn't my business because it was between her and him, and my brother when he grows older, and that I still had to maintain respect towards the family friend since he's an adult. Kind of solidified my anger and hurt, and it escalated to the point where I would dread seeing his car in the driveway or even hearing his voice and just sit in a nearby park or go straight in my room. 

Things got better when  my mom heard me having a big cry session (I thought I was home alone lol), and from then on instead of him coming to the house, my mom and brother would drive out to meet up with him. This worked until quarantine. He's started coming over more often again and I guess there's trauma because I still feel anxious and like I want to cry when I hear him. I've stayed quiet because I know that there wasnt a way for them to meet up outside (thank you Miss Corona) but the times I've hinted to my mom that I don't like him coming so often she'd get huffy, and both adults are saying that since it's been so long and I can't change it, I should stop being so immature.

So I guess in short, WIBTA if I just  told her straight how I really can't stand him coming to our house and that since our city has a pass for outside activity, they can go back to meeting up somewhere else?

"i just recently graduated, so i saw everyone i hung out with everyday, and we usually just made plans at lunch or something. the first 4-5 months of quarantine, i barely spoke to these people who i actually considered some of my best friends. this wasn’t because i didn’t want to be friends with them or anything, i just have always been a very quiet person, and reaching out/making plans has never been my thing. i grew up not even talking to my family that much, only ever seeing them during christmas or something. so usually, unless it’s my birthday or some special event i’m apart of, i never ask people to hang out cause i’m just not a very interesting person, and i never really know what to do for fun. i just go with whatever’s going on. and since i’ve been friends with these people for about 3 years now, i know they all know that’s just how i am, and i thought they all just kind of accepted that that’s how i was, cause we’ve even talked about it and they seemed fine with it.

either way, i still think of my friends and very close/good friends. but it seems like all of them aren’t on the same page. my VERY best friend recently just told me she’s felt like we hadn’t actually been friends since quarantine started, even though we still hung out once or twice a month, one of those times being a whole weekend road trip, and another being for my birthday. she seemed completely fine, our friendship seemed like it was the same. but her and a couple other friends have said that they feel like i just haven’t reached out enough for us to actually be close anymore.

"So I signed up in this driving school website for driving lessons (I looked in the government website for approved schools). Some time later I get a text msg (exactly) ""Hi \[my name\], Please confirm if you will be joining in-class  tomorrow at 9.00 am, Thanks"" and then ""\[school name\] \[school address\]"". I checked the website just to be sure, and the address matches, so it should be ok.

&amp;#x200B;

I respond ""I'll be there"", and they reply ""Ok thanks"".

&amp;#x200B;

So next morning I show up at the address, it's one of those big parking lots with restaurants, stores and small business we have here in Canada. No sign of a driving school though.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the thing though, from where I'm from, this is a big red flag for a scam, which I was already feeling since they sent me a message asking me to show up next day, no word on how much they would charge me, what are the plans from the lessons, etc . If that happened on where I'm from, I was being kidnapped for the third time by now. But whatever... They say Canada is safe...

&amp;#x200B;

So I send a message: ""How do I find the school?"". One minute later someone calls me, but I don't want to answer. Partly because that's how a kidnapper would identify his victim - by the one that picks up the phone (yeah yeah, I'm a little paranoid), but mostly because it's a simple question, just tell me how to get there! Another phone calls me and I don't answer either.

&amp;#x200B;

So I get a text message ""Please call me"". And I answer ""Nah, went to the address, couldn't find it. This whole thing is weird. Looks like a scam, I'm out"". A minute later they reply ""School is open"" and ""I am here"". That didn't help me find it, so I just took off. went buy groceries (that I planned to do after the class) with my phone ringing nonstop.

&amp;#x200B;

Later (exaclty): ""Hi \[my name\], very unfortunate that you could not find the school. There is main entrance with sign board  \[business name, but it's some kind of clinic\], you open the main entrance and come to upper level first one is \[another business\], 2nd is \[another business\] and third is suite \[number on the address\], \[name of the driving school\]"" and then ""Our school instructor can give you ride if you want to come now"" and then ""Or give me a call"".

&amp;#x200B;

Is it so hard to tell people how to get to your business instead of giving them just half the info needed? and like hell I would get a ride from a stranger now... Am I the paranoid asshole? Or just paranoid?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Ok, I get it, I probably wasn't getting kidnapped (even though that's what people think right before they do get kidnapped). But it did sound very scammy. When people try to call me to give me very simple information (""3rd floor above \[business name\]"", or ""Entrance at \[ \]"") I start thinking that they want to stall, try to hide something, or try to make you do something/go somewhere else, and since you're already there you go and do it. That's how scams work. But yeah, I agree I get a little paranoid.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 2: For people saying I didn't make effort trying to find the place. I did. These plazas (that's the word I was looking for) usually have kind of a billboard with a bunch of brands and establishments working on the plaza. I did find the billboard, but didn't find the name of the driving school. I looked on googlemaps where you can find some pictures of the place, it had a picture of an empty classroom and some people next to cars (no photo of the entrance). I actually know how to drive (10 years driving from where I'm from, never got even a scratch on my car), but since I moved to Canada, even though everyone I know says I should just pay for someone to teach me how to pass the test, I believe people should do a formal training of the law and how driving works here (one of the reasons insurance is expensive is because everyone wants to save on learning how to drive properly). So I woke up early on the weekend and walked for 30 minutes to the address provided at 0 degrees and snowing. So yeah, I did make effort to find the place.",Not the A-hole,0

So then she says, “Ok, tell you what. *My name* can drop me off on Saturday and then have her come pick me back up on Monday.” - like seriously lady?! You want me to drive 8 hours one freaking way, drop your mean ol’ butt off at your parents house (that I’m apparently not welcome in!) and drive 8 hours back home. Then do the same two days later. No freaking way! That’s 16 hours (without traffic I should add!) in one day! 

So of course I said no. In fact, I said “hell fucking no; is that bitch insane?” MIL threw a big fit and was crying that this may be the last time she’ll ever see her parents. (FYI - her parents are healthy as heck!). She said I’m now not welcome in her home for Thanksgiving and if I apologize she will maybe allow me to drive her to her parents house.

She also got her brother and sister calling my fiancé and saying that I’m a big asshole and ungrateful and should be honored MIL felt safe in my car. Fiancé’s sister texted me saying she hopes I feel horrible for the rest of my life if anything happens to their grandparents and MIL couldn’t say goodbye.

So redditors - Am I the Asshole for not driving my future mother-in-law to her parents house?

edit: the response “hell fucking no...” I said was to my fiancé. MIL didn’t hear it. Fiancé was texting with her about all this and he responded, “unfortunately, *my name* won’t be able to drive you.” and left it at that. I apologize, I should’ve added that in!",Not the A-hole,0
"I turned on the heater because he was in the shower and I was sitting by it. When he got out of the shower he came next to me and pushed me out of the way and he was like ""well I was trying to get by"".

He then said ""sorry"" and then I said "" I'm sorry, babe. just tell me that you want to move next time because I can't figure out anything if you don't say something""

Then he got upset and told me ""well I guess you don't accept apologizes"" and I said ""I just said make sure you say something next time."" And it was true. 

He was right by the heater and we both tend to be a little cold when when we get out of the shower so we like to sit by heater to warm up a little. He didn't tell me he needed to get somewhere. I can't read minds.

"So basically this is one of the worst teachers out there, you know those arrogant ones who don't know how to explain and shit. So basically I was sitting for my Biology IB exam and she was supervising. I'm not gonna lie I brought two phones to the exam in order to cheat and I left an old one on her desk and the other one was in my pocket. 
So 30 minutes go by and I decide to start cheating on my Paper until she sees me, so I immediatly and instinctively put my phone in my boxers. I'm 100% serious. She obviously saw it and called the school principal, who asked me to lift up my shirt, lift my pants up to my knees, and empty my pockets, to what i responded that they were violating my human rights or some bullshit like that I don't remember because I was fucking nervous and I'm terrified of people watching my naked body. The thing is they have no right to check your crotch area, so I finished my paper and had to slowly, very slowly walk to her desk and hand in the paper, with a fucking iPhone in my underwear (tight).

"Throwaway account.

**Background: (Sorry it's so long)**

So I (29F) live in an area where it costs a lot of money for living expenses. People don't move out of their family home unless they're married (or have 2 incomes).

Bf (33M) is one of 8 siblings who grew up in the family home. The people currently living there are bf's oldest sister Fran (42F), bf's mom(60+F), bf (33M), bf's other sister (37F) and her 3 kids (18F, 15F, 7F).

Long story short, the family home was handed down Fran.

Fran is quite controlling and manipulative. If she doesn't get her way, she'll scream and cry until she does. Nobody wants to stand up to her because they don't want to be her target.

Fran hates me with every fiber of her being. I don't know exactly why as she doesn't talk to me directly. So far, I heard it's because: I changed him; I came over when I wasn't allowed (At the time, I thought it was okay); She hates looking at me.

His family says they don't hate me, but they don't want to disagree with her.

My bf and I have been together for about 4 years. He warned me about his crazy sister and family, but I thought it's fine! Everyone's family is crazy (I should have known better).

Fran gave my bf a list of demands in exchange for me being allowed at the house. Bf did everything Fran asked (such as pay higher rent, redid the pool and maintained it, fixed the roof, maintained the yard, etc) all with his own money.

Then, suddenly Fran bans me from the house.

Bf's pissed. He felt like Fran used him to get what she wanted.

So he says fuck it, not helping her anymore with *anything*. He stopped going to any family functions where I wasn't invited, which was all of them because they're all at Fran's house.

He basically moved in with me and my parents (although we've since moved to our own place). He still paid rent to her sister, even though he was rarely there.

He tried many times to set up a meeting between us and with the family or with her therapist, and she always told him no.

I was really sad for a while, but I accepted it.

**Now for the AITA part: (happened in late 2019)**

Last year, I got a new puppy, Mika. Although my bf and I were together when we got her, I'm the one who pays all the expenses, and she's under my name only.

My nephew (7M) and my bf's niece (7F) go to the same school and go to each other's houses for play dates and such. My nephew is gushing to her and her family, and bf's niece really wants to see Mika.

Note: Bf's nieces and nephews know who I am because I helped bf babysit on many occasions when I was allowed at the house.

So bf's sisters and mom ask him if Mika (and only Mika) can come to the house.

Bf told me and I straight up said no. I'm not allowed there, so there's no way in hell Mika could go. She was still young at the time, and I wouldn't leave her anywhere if I didn't trust the people.

Bf agrees with me and told them off. They were pretty upset about it, but I don't feel like they have a reason to be.

AITA for not letting my puppy go to my bf's family home?

Edit: To clarify, bf hasn't paid any rent to Fran since we got our own place (Hallelujah!). He gave her 1 month notice.

"okay first of all, i’m on a phone so i apologise for bad grammar and formatting. 

so i’m 15, female, and i have this thing called misophonia (if you don’t know what it is, google it, it’s hard to explain)... my family all know about this but every time they walk past me they make an obnoxiously loud chewing noise, it angers me just thinking about it, but i can’t help that. then they wonder why i start freaking out and yelling. they get mad at me for overreacting and tell me i’m “just looking for attention” and that i should calm down since it’s not a big deal. so recently i’ve been shutting them out, i’ve been ignoring them when they try to talk to me cause i’m just sick of it. i’m sick of them making fun of me for it. 

(background info, just incase you were wondering, this isn’t the only reason i’m mad at them, they know i’m super insecure about my appearance but every chance they get they call me ugly or fat, they call me useless, annoying, worthless, not good enough. my brother and sister get straight A’s and i get C’s and B’s because of some sort of learning disability that runs in the family that they must not have gotten. i’m the dumb child, the disappointment.)

Hey guys. Thanks for taking the time to click on the post as I am in a little bit of a debacle.

My best friend (who I will call Syd) and I have been very close for four or so years. We are a part of a group with two other mutual friends. We have gone through a lot with each other, and have spent the majority of our time with each other throughout our teen hood (we are all in the 16-17 age group) 

A year back, our group happened to come into contact with another group of girls. There is one boy for each girl in each group and we all just sort of hit it off with one another. Syd, at the time, started dating another girl while I started dating another one of the girls in the group (who I will call Lena). Our relationship lasted a few months as lost highschool relationships do, and it was a good learning experience for me, although it did have a rough ending. My ex decided to tell her parents that I was a terrible boyfriend and started saying things to my own friends that weren’t true. There were quite a few, but I will say, the one that stood out the most for me was when she called me out for spending too much time with my friends and not enough with her, and that “no girl in their right mind” would have the desire to be interested in me. I took this pretty hard as I put my blood sweat and tears into making it all work, even though it inevitably didn’t. This happening strained the possibility for us to continue as friends and left a huge gap in our combined friend-group. My best friends were starting to try and balance their time between me and them, and although I understood why, it hurt.

Fast forward 4 or so months, Syd broke up with his girlfriend and so did one of our other best friends, so things were starting to look up for our friendship and our relationship felt a lot less strained for a few months.

Once again, fast forward a few months, and it seems as though these two best friends of mine have entered back into relationships with these girls, although this time, my best friend of four years Syd has taken interest in my ex, and vice versa. It has been a super awkward month for us, and one that has been full of tension. He knows that I am aware of his endeavours and asked for my support a week ago. I told him that I will not choose to support him in his effort to date Lena, but also said that at the end of the day, it is his choice, and what ever choice he makes, it should be final. Of course, I also said that I can’t erase the four years that we have spent together and that my feelings for him as a friend will never go away, but maybe weaken to the point of no return. After I had said my piece he called me a selfish guy, who “can’t stand to see his best friend happy”. So, Reddit, am I the asshole?

"CONTEXT

My GF and me are living together with our one year old toddler. She started a study progam last year, and I am the one who is the main earner.

So I am now getting a new job, because of better opportunities in the matter of career and the salary is way higher. Downside of the new job is that there is no option to work from home in the beginning and I have to stay there for 40 - 45 hours a week. Before I was working 35 - 40 hours a week but with 15% working from home. 

Before this decision was made I was talking to her about it, and she was supportive, and said I shall do what I desire.

Today we got into a little fight, nothing bad, but she was complaining, that I will let her alone with doing everything with our daughter, and I will just be working.

"When I say my aunt and uncle are bad people, it's an understatement. They named my eldest cousin after my uncle specifically so they could steal an inheritance left for him when our adopted grandparents died. He had to join the military to pay for school, they'd left him \~$58k (they gave that to each of my siblings too). When that cousin started working, they started leeching him for money until he got married and his wife cut them off. There's been other things, like them constantly needing my dad to bail them out of debt. One will file bankruptcy, the other gets a credit card, they blow through it, then they flip and my dad bails them out. The very last time my dad bailed them out, it was because they took my youngest cousin's information (she was living with them at the time), took out a credit card in her name, and then accrued a heap of debt. When she started getting collection calls, they cried to my dad to bail them out again. He told them that if they did that again, he would report them. 

That got handled and my youngest cousin got engaged. The guy is awesome, and he seemed to understand the somewhat predatory nature of his future in-laws, so he's moved them across the country now. My Aunt and Uncle now have decided to move out of state and they're talking about moving to live with or near the youngest. Cousin's fiance is super nice though, so he's like ""yeah, totally, you can stay with us until you buy a house"" and those of us who know how much they have screwed over their kids are finding it harder to keep our peace. If they move to the same state, fine, whatever, but my worry is that Fiance is suggesting they move in with him and my cousin, who still doesn't know what they did.   


On one hand, I shouldn't meddle, right? On the other hand, they'll be so far that it'll be harder for my dad to bail them out. If he reports them, my cousins will all be crushed over news of what they've done. They'll lose their parents once for them going to jail for fraud and again over the betrayal.

"This title is badly worded, but read for the story. My younger sister (15f) and I (18f) are both teenagers and live together w our parents. We get along very well.
I really like gift giving and my sister knows this. This year, I am making all of my friends little christmas baskets. Each basket has personalized trinkets, some bought and some homemade, and of course, candy. I spent all of November on them and they were all finished at least a week ago. I showed my sister the presents while I was making them, so she knew they existed and what was in them. Obviously, I did not show her hers. The two things most important things in her basket (to this story) is one of those giant wine bottle holder things, which I filled full of her favorite candy, and a painting of us with our dog. 
I put all of the presents in my closet, hidden on the highest shelf. All of them were wrapped with handmade cards on them. 
For some context, my sister gets away with a lot of things. She is pretty spoiled and has a lot of expensive clothes and technology, a lot more than I do. She also eats my ""personal"" food a lot, which irks me bc I have a history of disordered eating and some pretty narrow dietary restrictions, so it's hard to find food I can eat and stay healthy on sometimes. However, she never really means any harm, so my parents and I dont really do anything about it. 
A few days ago, I went into my closet to see every single present unwrapped. While I was out, she had gone through every present and eaten all of the candy from every single one, including her own. Meaning she saw her present and ruined her own surprise. 
I was furious and told her she ruined the things I had spent months making and she doesn't get a present anymore. She cried, saying that she really loved the painting, and she needs the painting. 
At the time, I didnt think I was the asshole, but I still didnt throw away her present because it is our last year living together before I go to college, and as I said, we're very close. I wanted her to keep the decoration in her room after I leave. 
Now I am feeling more and more like the asshole. I have been giving her the silent treatment for days, even though we normally watch TV every night, eat lunch together, drive around to look at Christmas lights, etc.
I feel like maybe she doesn't deserve this, but she also ruined gifts I made for other people as well. WIBTA if I threw out the painting?

"I feel like I need to gauge from others whether this is me being an asshole or not.

I'm engaged and starting to plan my wedding. But we're very relaxed on wedding plans right now because who knows when it will be safe to get married. My dad realized we were talking weddings because I asked him for his professional opinion on which wedding venues have the best food. He took the time to pull me aside and ask me that I make space for my stepmom to do special parts of the planning with me like wedding dress shopping, that traditionally the mother of the bride would do. He said he knows I might only want her involved where he is but she deserves better after all this time and it would be the kind thing to do.

He actually anticipated exactly what I was planning. She has been my stepmom since I was 9 and she's a nice person and in general I have a good relationship with her but we have always had this different opinion on our relationship. She has always seen it as a parent/child relationship and she considers me her kid. While I see her as my stepmother and that being different to my mom who I lost when I was 5. I have never let her in on the mom stuff. I didn't celebrate her on Mother's Day but I did celebrate her on Stepfamily day and in general this has been a challenge in our relationship and it has hurt her feelings because she never had children of her own and I think she sees me as the closest thing she has. She does genuinely love me and she wants the best for me. Which makes it all so hard. It would be so much easier if being an awesome stepmom was enough for her.

So I was thinking of including her in the aspects I was planning to ask my dad to help with, which is stuff he already agreed to help with. It's basically going to be food and venue since he knows these things being a chef and he has attended a lot of weddings. I was going to do the dress fitting with my moms family and the rest will just be my fiance and me (he's doing the food stuff too it's just that we wanted kind of an expert opinion since we have it).

I was thinking for the wedding that he and my stepmom would walk together and get a special dance at the wedding.

"A couple of months ago my grandmother gave me her mothers weddingdress and  a beautiful matching half-jacket made out of real fur. My grandma gave them to me as I’m the eldest female of her grandchildren and I love these pieces of clothing, it feels special to have them and try them on. They are in pristine condition seeing as my great grandmother got married in the early 1930’s.

Now I’m facing two kinds of backlash and I need to know if I would be the asshole here. 

1. My friend freaked out when I told her about the fur and she called me crazy for even ”entertaining the thought of keeping it.” She loathes the animal fur industry and is passionate for animal rights, her point is that even though the fur is a very old family heirloom it’s still animal cruelty and sends a message. But it feels wrong to simply throw it out so I’m conflicted. 

2. I have a younger female cousin, M , who became very upset about this. She says that it’s unfair that I should have these pieces simply because I’m the oldest and that she deserves to have them because M never got to meet our great grandmother as the latter passed away some years before M was born. My aunt, M’s mother, agrees and wants me to hand over the dress and the fur. Our grandmother tries to stay neutral but she wants to avoid drama, which I understand nor blame her for. Would I be the asshole if I kept it for myself? 

- Regarding 1, I don’t intend on wearing the fur as a normal piece of clothing, but I’d like to keep it and the dress in good condition for as long as I can.
- Regarding 2, I see my cousins point and understand that she feels that it’s very unfair, so I’m very conflicted. 

So reddit, WIBTA?

EDIT - M has recieved other heirlooms such as jewelry that has been passed down in the family. 

EDIT2 - I mentioned to aunt and M that I would be happy to let M wear the dress for her wedding when the time comes but Aunt and M still wants me to give them the items. Their point being that the dress and jacket holds more significance as it is a wedding dress and it is unfair I should get it because I’m the eldest",Not the A-hole,0
"Ok so some backstory I (16M) have a friend also of same age who for the last 3 years has been a little bit ignoring of his studies. Now we both are in 12th grade and we are in India so some things might not be regular to everyone. 
Now onto the main part since 9 th grade he has been way too ignorant about his studies. Not only has he been avoiding tests/classes but also been bunking classes. Now due to the covid situation we all were promoted from 11th to 12th grade without exams in March  and everything seemed just fine. But as soon as our tutions (we go to same tuitions) started around April 12 for 12th he at first was determined to study hard because he wants to become a surgeon. But roll around June he has stopped studying/giving homework attending/watching lectures. Now he has a perfectly good reason to not study as his mother is having some heart issues and she needs someone by her side but he has been giving this same reason for past 3 months and I feel like he is using this excuse for his own benefits. Now before you jump up saying 'What if his mother's health has been deterorating and you just don't know that?' Just so you know he has an elder brother in college and he does his studies during night time and is generally free during day and helps around the house. Also I heard from a common friend that he has been giving different routines to everyone he knows like a month ago he told me he has started to watch physics lecture and is now going to complete 3 chapters..listening to that I was very proud of him but some of his other friends told me that he is not studying at all and has been roaming around all day till 10 PM since August or he is completing chemistry first but he hasn't attended 1 class since July and isn't even attending test and when someone calls him to tell him that 'Bro the test is about to be over here are the ans' he just says 'nah next time.'
Also he thinks that he can prepare the entire syllabus in just 3 months while the scholar students can't remember what was taught in April.

"So here's the backstory. 

I run my own computer business, it's not my main job, more so it's a business to track expenses and a write off. But one thing I love doing is helping people. Friends, family and customers love donating their old laptops to me for parts/use but I never sell them.

Now I am picky, the oldest laptops I generally take are about 10 years old and usually prefer then to work and be in decent shape. The reason being is, I buy parts in bulk and upgrade these, then give them away to people in need. I won't give away something that doesn't work or has damage to it.

I don't benefit from this because I can't write it off, so I do it personally not through my business. But I generally upgrade the memory to 8gb, replace the hard drive with an SSD then upgrade to Windows 10. Any laptop even with a first gen I3 will run like a rocket for everyday computing with those upgrades.


So here is the AITA part

A 10 year old laptop is pretty much worthless. With new laptops starting around $250 for Windows and $120 for Chromebook, they just aren't worth anything. But people try and sell them (marketplace/Craigslist) for $150-200 and they are not even upgraded at all.

So I go ahead and offer to take them on donation for my cause because I indirectly point out they are not worth anything, but I would offer $20 for gas/convenience. 

Now to be truthful, I would donate these after doing some work on them and I know everyone will just scoff at me when they receive the email/message. But I am ready for the downvotes!!!

Edit: if the laptop is relatively modern, I do offer to buy it just for less than market value and explain the cause.

I do this as a way to give back to people and my community. I don't get to even expense any of this, not the parts I buy or my time. But it's not about that. It's about helping people in need and giving back.",Asshole,1
"I’ve been taking oral contraceptives for about 6 years now. When I first started, I was worried about what other people would think (I was raised in a pretty “sex-is-taboo” household) and hid that I was taking them very well. Now, however, I’m in my mid twenties and I’m comfortable enough in my skin that I don’t really mind if people know I’m on the pill. 

Anyway, I was out on a double date with a couple we know last night and the alarm on my watch started going off (vibration). It was time for me to take my pill. While we’re all chatting, I reach down into my purse that’s beside me in the booth and get my pill, put it in my mouth, and take a drink of water. Whole thing probably took 30 seconds. 

My friend didn’t comment, but her boyfriend made a face and said “did you just take something?”

I said “yeah, my birth control.”

He made another face and said, “that’s inappropriate don’t you think?”

I just kind of exchanged a look with my boyfriend who seemed as lost as I was. I mumbled an “uh, ok” cause I hate confrontation. 

He went on, “you should probably go to the bathroom to do that. It’s really not polite to take that kind of pill in front of a group of people. We get it, you have sex.”

I really had no idea what to say, so my boyfriend changed the subject to the game that was on over our heads at the bar and the night carried on. 

I was pretty much floored. Wtf? I had been doing this for a while now, any time I’m out and my alarm goes off, I’ll just take my pill and go about my day. Wouldn’t it be like taking any other medication? Or Advil? I don’t really see the problem. AITA?",Not the A-hole,0
"Okay I’ll try not going to make this long. I’m planning to get married this August and covid wedding planning has been a nightmare. 

Anyways my colors are dusty blue for bridesmaids and navy suits for the boys. In order not to look like a bridesmaid my MIL tried to avoid dusty blue dresses and decided to get a navy dress for the wedding. She picked one out and I happen to be there when she did and I liked it so she ordered that one. 

Flash forward to today my moms trying to find a dress for the wedding but is worried about picking the same dress as my MIL. I know slim chance that would happen but I asked my MIL to send a picture dress she got. She sent me this picture. 
[MIL dress](https://imgur.com/gallery/N8p3bff?s=sms) 
I was a little shocked by how light it was. I mean the description says light pink and even when I texted her ask what color it was she said “very light pink/ cream”. I was surprised because usually only the bride wears white and I thought it was taboo to wear something that was close in color to bride. When I showed it to my mom she was also shocked and said people might judge her for wearing it at the wedding.

After hearing that I realized I did want my MIL dress to take any attention away from my and future fiancé even if it’s negative. However I always worry about being high maintenance or a bridezilla. Plus with covid I’ve had to give a lot of wedding traditions up. So I understand it might be harder to find a dress in these times.

My fiancé thinks the dress is not a big deal because it’s not white. However I decided I had enough of giving in to covid excuses and asked him to ask him mom if she was worried it was to close to white. She said the navy dress didn’t fit and she’s tried on lots of others she didn’t like. Also that dress was obviously cream and of course everyone would look at the bride first not her. 

So AITAH for overreacting about the dress color or am I justified in being concerned about my MIL’s dress?

Edit: also for context because people are saying it’s not very bridal here’s my dress but I had it altered to have flutter sleeves which look like the sleeves on the dress she choose.

For a while now she had been making me feel really uncomfortable because she would say really weird things and invade my privacy often, and she treats my friends poorly. The thing is I have been distancing myself from her lately, but she has noticed that I’ve been distancing myself from her, she asked if I was mad at her, I say no even though I am but I just can’t tell her because I don’t want to hurt her feelings.

"I have (officially) been living with my friend for the past year. However, I have always preferred staying somewhere else during that time and hardly spent time at home (about 1 night a week max). There are many reasons why I preferred to stay out of the house, I won’t go into detail about that further though.

My housemate has constantly been on my nerves about that, telling me that I was neglecting her and being a bad friend. It came up at least once every time we saw each other in either a stupid comment or in an actual attempt to guilt trip me into staying at home more. This made me want to spend even less time with her; viscous circle.

My living situation was really impacting my mental health and I was scared to lose my housemate as a friend. So I stayed longer than I should have and only recently decided to finally move out.

I told the housemate that I was moving out within the month which is my legal right according to our rental contract. As expected, she did not take it well and she accused me of betraying her (those were her words).
She asked me to stay at least a while longer and pay rent (I haven’t been in the house since lockdowns and still been paying) because else she would have to cover for it. I told her that wasn’t an option because I can’t afford to pay double rent and I have a new place.

To elaborate more; her family owns the house, she is not paying for rent, only for utilities. I paid rent to her and that was basically her income for the month. She also has several other people living in the house for free because they prefer staying there over their own place.

"Here's the story.

I was having a conversation at work with a colleague about how white tattoos are so rare, even though they look good on dark skin. We looked at a couple of pictures and determined that they are underrated.

Fast forward 20 minutes. I find a picture online of a white henna back tattoo that looks amazing, so I post it as my status on WhatsApp. 5 minutes later my girlfriend explodes on me for my apparent audacity. She says I made her cry at work and it's definitely my fault she's crying.

Side note: her previous boyfriend cheated on her and she and I have been dating for a year. Give or take a month.

I responded by telling her ""I'm not fond of being attacked when you don't even understand what's going on"" 

She said she doesn't need to understand, because I should know that I shouldn't be posting pictures of other women. She then proceeded to either block me or switch off her phone. I'm not sure which. AITA?

INFO: She initially responded with sarcasm and a meme, I laughed in response. It was cute and funny. Then she turned around and said she was sarcastic, but now that's she's thinking about it it's a shitty post and I shouldn't have posted it. Then all hell broke loose.

"My mom recently passed away while living with my younger sister. I was present during Mom’s final moments, and am grateful that my hero and angel is now at peace. 

My mom had stage one cancer last year. Her team of doctors believed it was curable. My sister, however, encouraged her to follow a holistic cancer therapy recommended by a chiropractor. He prescribed juice,daily coffee enemas, and periodic blood tests. 

I told my mom the therapy was considered ineffective. She replied that she would try it until she knew for sure. 

Last October and again in March, the chiropractor told Mom she was nearing remission, because his blood tests showed a miraculous reduction in cancer cells. Mom excitedly told many people about her results, and gave his number to anyone who asked. 

In April, Mom had a stroke, yet my sister, who was her health care proxy, refused to bring her to the hospital. After finally admitting her to the hospital in May, the doctors recommended hospice, because imaging tests revealed the cancer had spread throughout her entire body. 

My sister told me not to visit her home while my mom was in hospice there. We disagree on politics, philosophy, and most everything else. 

I defiantly made the trip, and spent several days by Mom’s bedside, telling her sweet things like how much I loved her. I tried very hard not to anger my sister, yet almost got kicked out when I told her my dogs had better end-of-life care. 

My sister prevented Mom from seeking proper care for over a year, and further denied the comfort medications prescribed by hospice, despite her flailing and tears. Instead she forced her to eat apple sauce, thinking this would restore Mom’s health, but it ultimately led to her last breath. 

My other siblings are in denial. They are anti-vax, pro-insurrectionists, who blame the hospital for Mom’s death. And they all reminded me, this was Mom’s choice. 

My sister has planned a celebration of life, in Mom’s hometown, where I still live. 

I will not be attending, because I will not endure the misinformation that will be shared at the event. And even though I was invited, I was warned not to share my story. 

I’m choosing to celebrate Mom’s life by reporting the chiropractor for practicing oncology without a license. I am choosing to spare my sister. I will not report her and her family for elder abuse, because it would destroy what’s left of my dear Mom’s family. 

I send them peace, love and blessings from afar until I can actually begin to speak with them again.

"WIBTA? 

My brother (50m) and I (34f) have had a tumultuous relationship for my whole adult life. I think? 

I never realised at the time but for some reason recently I've had this epiphany that he is emotionally abusive. It has been a root cause that affected a lot of aspects in my mental health and self esteem. But, so a may say this is just standard brother and sister behaviour.

Conversations feel like honey traps for some information he can use against me, or to randomly start an argument. 

One notable example (among many) would be in my siblings group chat (which is no longer a thing) he asked if anyone has watched any good things on Netflix recently, and we all made a suggestion. My suggestion was 'the crown', and he, for lack of a better term, just 'switched'. He had a really aggressive rant about how the royal family etc are murderers and r*pists and how my liking of this tv show condones these things. I just thought it was a good tv show, and I am the least political person so these comments were really out of nowhere. 

Other examples are him insulting my sister because she didn't want to discuss a subject that he did, and resulted in him calling her uneducated. She is a teacher. She works in education and has a degree. My sister was understandably upset, and my mother messaged him to just please leave her alone and he told our mum to 'f*** off and that she is an embarrassment to the family.' 

Overtime, I have progressively seen him and messaged him significantly less. Which only irritates him more and has made me feel quite guilty. He says it's me that's the problem and I'm rude and immature, and classless. He's my big brother and likes to make sure everyone is in check, which my other brothers seem to appreciate and encourage, as does my father. 

My father keeps asking me to be nicer to my brother, and that I'm rude by ignoring him. I've really tried to look inward and be nice to him but I still find myself getting anxious and my stomach dropping when I see a have a message from my brother. 

My mother still naturally loves him and hopes for me to have him at the wedding. Wanting to 'keep the peace' I have done so. But i really don't have the energy anymore. My fiancé is so good to me and it's making me think that I deserve better from my brother, which will never happen. 

When my fiancé is around, my brother is lovely, and can be the nicest person ever, so I have no doubt that he'd be nice at my wedding. When he's nice like this I feel guilty for even thinking of cutting him off.

Should I just have him at the wedding and then be done with him? Or try and repair the relationship? ",Not the A-hole,0
"F married to M 21 years. 2 children  (10, 12). From the start we’ve had some unhealthy patterns. I’ve seen therapists. My husband would say that he didn't have any problems and if I was upset that it was something that I needed to look into. I’m about to get another therapist because the last one said I didn’t need her services and I want another perspective. My husband has recently started seeing a therapist. I'm really happy that he's trying it out. 
My husband doesn’t like to do much and he enjoys his time in rooms away from the family and looking at his phone. He’s retired. I like to do things so I try to balance his need to be alone with my need for a family time.One of our patterns is that if I’m upset and try to talk to him somehow I leave feeling worse. I don’t feel heard or cared for but he says he does. I usually leave feeling like I have to care for his needs but nothing gets solved on my end. I have shared these feelings with him. It's difficult having a lot of hurts over the years that don't get resolved and compound. We’ve consider separating but we have built a life together and he is the person I spend the most amount of time with. Yesterday we had friends over and the daughter of our friends feels over leveraged. She didn’t want to do a family excursion the next day. My husband commiserated with her. He said, “I get it. Sometimes you just want to have a day to yourself where you don’t have to do anything.” I was a little hurt considering I have done most of the planning for our life and always took note of his needs. I adjust schedules and most times we don’t do anything. Out of respect, I run things by him. 
This morning we were on our way to the gym at 9am. I tried to share my feelings so he wouldn’t get defensive. I mentioned the conversation he had with my friends daughter and how I felt sad that he does not notice how much I do in order to make sure his needs are met. He said that he was pretending to be our oldest son but my husband has made this complaint repeatedly so it felt dismissive. I asked if he could see how I could mistake his interaction as coming from him and regardless I’m still hurt. He said, “I don’t know what to tell you.” I asked him if he cared that I was hurt and he said that it was early. I asked when a better time would be and he said maybe later. I told him that I hoped he wouldn’t get defensive. He said he wasn’t. So I told him that it sounds like he just doesn’t care about my feelings. Crickets. Then he said something completely off topic. “Look at that guy using hand signals in his car.” It was the last straw and there was no way I could spend the next hour acting like nothing happened. We got to the gym and I said, “You can uber home. You haven’t cared about my needs yet expect me to care about yours.” I left him there and drove home. I have never done anything like that before. He did make it home safe. I can agree that it was a jerk move but did he have it coming? AITA?",Asshole,1

I tried calling her twice but the first time it wouldnt connect through messemger so I called her phone and it went straight to voicemail. I immediately called her mom and told her what i knew and she called the police and my fiances boss (they work together so they used to share bosses.) I got in my car and drove towards her work to see if i could find any debris, she got out of work at midnight so i figured if she did crash it would have been cleaned by then because it's an interstate highway and has a lot of traffic. While i was driving back i got a text from my fiance saying sorry she didnt have service and that she had gone to the bar with some friends after work and just didnt think to let me know. At this point she was already home but didn't realise anyone had tried to contact her because when she regained service she got a bunch of notifications at the same time. When I got back home she was upset that i had contacted her mom and that her mom called her boss and the police. AITA for being upset at this point?

She was also with friends for 3+ hours and i keep telling her that's not an excuse for not being able to contact me.

"Soooo I grew up on a tropical island with my dads grandparents. I don't live there anymore, but I told my new friend stories about it and she suggested we go there together for her 25th birthday. (And we could have free housing with my grandparents). I called my mom to ask her permission but she was dealing with a lot of stuff at that point so she said she needed time to think about it.
 The day after, she says that it is a good idea but that she wants to go with us. She also says that my brother should come too. And my brother wanted to take his friend too. So now this has gone from a fun girl's vacation, just me and my friend, to a family vacation that is much more complicated. In addition, my mom and my dads grandparents don't like eachother. So my mom said she would find housing separately from us.

 Anyways, my friend and I got our own plane tickets. When I called my grandma to ask if we could crash at her house, I didn't mention that my mom was going, just saying that my friend would be the one driving us(I don't have my liscence). This is because I didn't want my mom to feel uncomfortable since I know she doesn't like my dads grandparents and has said before that she didn't go to the island because the grandparents were still there. 
Today, I told my mom that I hadn't mentioned her to my grandparents. She was hurt and furious, saying that I had lied to my grandma and that she would never have wanted me to hide that she was going. I apologized, and said that I never wanted this trip to be such a complicated thing. She took this as me saying I didn't want her to go on the vacation, which while I hadn't originally planned on her going, I thought it would be fun to have her along too. 
I feel bad because now she says she might revoke her ticket, and that I am a lier and don't care about her. Am I the asshole? ",Not the A-hole,0

"I (17F) have gone to church every Sunday for my entire life up until a few years ago. Really, more than every Sunday as I was always made to attend private Catholic schools (usually involving monthly to daily mass). Needless to say, I've attended my fair share of theology classes, Catholic events, etc. However, I would definitely consider myself atheist now. 

Recently, after a few years of freedom, my mom decided it was necessary to force me into attendance again. This has often caused me to have quite an emotional reaction as I HATE going. Not just because I feel like its a waste of time, but it feels extremely condescending to hear the priest pray for/talk down on non-believers. I'm also feminist and a lesbian so you can imagine. This has caused massive fights within my family as I've tried to argue that attending church makes me feel ostracized and only pushes me further from Catholicism. However, my mom continues to argue that it's a family activity and that I need to suck it up.

This came up again this Sunday as, after a few weeks of not attending, I was woken up by my adult sister (who is also Christian) and told to get ready. I started crying and essentially said that I'm not going. I only went after being threatened to have my mom stop paying for my schooling.

"Sorry for formatting, I’m on mobile. 

So in December me (19F) and my gf (19F) found ourselves in need of a place to live. My mom begged us to move in to my dementia-having grandparents house, saying it would be a massive help. We agreed that we’d take up all the bills of the house, and I started caring for my grandparents. 

Over Christmas, one of my aunts mentions that her partner, Bob (49M) will be coming to stay 1-2 nights a week soon for his work. This was the first we heard about it. Me and my gf both have trauma surrounding older male family members, so this was instantly a red flag. 

When Bob’s over he won’t do any house chores like taking care of shared spaces, giving my grandparents dinner, etc. He also has multiple other places to stay. 

He confronted me and I told him I’m uncomfortable with him staying, especially if we’re paying the bills and have been told it’s our space, and ask if he can let us know when he’s coming over. He went over to my mom’s house to basically tattle on us, and she gets mad at us for not upholding our ‘family values’ of generosity and hospitality. I’m forced to explain my trauma and emotional response, and she ends up agreeing with me that Bob doesn’t need to be there and mine and my gfs wellbeing should come first.

In a meeting with my aunties a few weeks later me and my gf clarify that we’d appreciate knowing when people are planning to drop by, and also that we don’t feel safe while Bob is staying the night. My mom calls me after to tell me she’ll fight for us while her and her siblings discuss. 

The next morning, my mom drops a text meant for her sisters in the wrong groupchat, saying that we’re not aligning with the ‘family values’, we’re the worst negotiators, stating it’s a sharehouse (when it was previously called our space by all of them), that we’re processing our trauma incorrectly, and that their ‘compromise’ is we continue to care for the house and pay the bills and anyone is allowed to stay if they let us know. I brought up that these conditions weren’t communicated to us before we moved in, that they said it would be our space, and that it’s unfair to call us bad negotiators when they refuse to give us a compromise beyond we just accept the current situation. Bob’s partner called us sexist and intolerant of family. My gf and I thanked them for letting us stay, apologised for causing conflict, and told them we’ll find a new place. 

On one hand, I understand that they’ve done us a favour by letting us stay, but it’s not like we haven’t taken care of my grandparents, the house, and the bills. I know I sound ungrateful, but I feel like they’re placing Bob’s wants over our need to feel safe in our home, choosing to support a man who hasn’t helped the family over me, who they’ve all said is essential.

"I have three funnels in my house. One is medium-sized silicone that is stored in the kitchen, one is small silicone that is stored in the kitchen, and one is small plastic that is stored near my husband's collection of kerosene lamps.

He goes camping a lot, and he initially bough metal kerosene lamps to take camping, but in the past \~4 years, he's been buying kerosene lamps for the house in case the power goes out. He will burn these even when we have full service of the electric grid because he ""likes the ambiance.""

I have told him, on so so so many occasions, that I do not want him to use my silicone food funnels for his kerosene. He has a funnel for the kerosene that is stored next to the lamps, and he should not need to be anywhere near the food funnels while filling his lamps.

He revealed that he moved the kerosene funnel to the garage, where he stores his camping stuff, because it's for camping, and that it's ""not convenient"" for him to go get it while putting kerosene in lamps that are in the house, so he uses the other funnels if he's filling the lamps while in the house. For the record, I also don't want the kerosene lamps burning in the house unless the power has gone out, but he burns them sometimes just for fun because of ""nostalgia"" for a time that was 100 years before he was born.

His argument when I breach this topic with him is always, ""It's not hurting the funnel."" My concern isn't the funnel. I can get a new funnel for very few dollars. My concern is that he doesn't see anything wrong with replacing the funnel in its drawer after he's used it for kerosene and merely rinsed it out (no soap, no dishwasher run, nothing other than lukewarm water to rinse it). This is not safe, and I can't tell when he's used the funnel on sight, so it could contaminate our food.

He says he shouldn't have to go to the garage every time he wants to put kerosene in a lamp. I say he should just stop using kerosene lamps in the house if the power is working (which it is, barring a storm, like in most American households). He says I'm being unfair and that the funnels belong to the house, so he should be allowed to use them as he wants. I say that's BS because he's misusing them. AITA?",Not the A-hole,0
"AITA for how I reacted to an old friend’s engagement?

Obligatory ""on mobile, ignore formatting issues; throwaway account due to privacy reasons.""

I, 30F, found out a couple of weeks ago that an old friend of mine, also 30F (we'll call her Sarah), announced her engagement through Facebook. We were best friends for a very long time, but as usual, life got in the way and we grew apart. We drop little messages to each other here and there, though. So when I found out the news on social media, I couldn't help but be a little upset that she didn't tell me directly beforehand.

Later, I sent her a text congratulating her. All she sent back was a thank you. I tried to ask this next part nicely, but I basically followed up by asking why she didn't tell me she got engaged before posting it on Facebook. She said that she only had time to tell close family and friends, and she got super excited and decided to post about it on Facebook so that it's easier for her family abroad and everyone else can know. I told her it hurt that I had to find out that way because I still considered her as a close friend of mine, despite us growing apart. She got upset and said that she was feeling like I was taking a happy moment away from her and make it all about me. I told her that wasn't the case, and that I'm trying to get her to understand my perspective. Then it kinda blew up with her saying that the reason we grew apart in the first place is that I was acting entitled to know everything about her life.

Needless to say, I was baffled. I have not heard from her since, but I feel like she is out of line. However, everyone is saying that I'm acting condescending about her engagement, which I don't think I am at all. I'm happy for her, truly, but I'm upset about the way I found out.

Before high school we never shared classes but now we have three together and in one of them our teacher always lets us choose who to partner with for projects. We also get a ""study buddy"" like our teacher calls it. Basically one Friday a month we get a class where we pair up with our study buddy to study stuff. Because we always get to choose, I always choose my best friend, and she always chooses me. We're study buddies and we're project partners every time in this class.

My stepsister doesn't have any really close friends and she struggles to find project partners sometimes.

On Friday we were asked to choose a project partner to work with for the next two months on a big project our teacher wants us to do in pairs. My best friend and I chose each other like always. There were four kids left who had nobody to naturally pair up with and my stepsister was one of them. She told the teacher she wanted me but the teacher said I had already chosen my project partner and she had three other kids to choose from. My stepsister really didn't want to work with the three choices she had so the teacher asked if I'd swap partners for this project and work with my stepsister. I said no. My best friend said no too. She said we work really well together.

When I got home after school and work Friday, my mom was waiting for me and she pulled me into the office and asked me why I didn't choose my stepsister as my project partner. She said she knew I was asked and given the choice to change and I wouldn't. She told me after 8 years of being sisters I should have an equally close if not closer relationship to her than my best friend (who I met in pre-k) and I shouldn't find it so easy to say no to my stepsister. I said I enjoy working with my best friend and we work well together and I didn't want to change that or work with my stepsister. My mom took my phone all weekend as a consequence and her husband told me like 10 times they expect us to put each other before any friendships because we're family.

"Let me lead with my husband (34M) and I (26F) have a great relationship. Rarely do we ever fight and we are able to openly talk to each other about difficult subjects. 

Recently while driving home from the store we passed a company that treated my husband like crap in an interview. This happened years ago but grinds his gears when he thinks about it (valid. The interviewer was horrid.) 

While he was talking about it I asked if he knew how old the interviewer was (or how old he looked) and my husband snapped at me saying “no why would I know that” in a pretty rude tone. Now I’m used to my husband as when he’s going through emotions he has a hard time coming down from them. Basically if he was telling you any story when he was upset at the situation it would sound like he was mad at you but he isn’t. I like to call it a vivid storyteller. 

Most of the time when it happens I understand he’s not actually upset with me he’s just in the heat of the memory but it does get to me sometimes. I told him he didn’t have to speak to me that way and he said he was sorry and he didn’t mean to. I then proceeded to tell him that he does that a lot where he’ll speak rudely without meaning to because his mom has brought it up as well. My husband got sad because he really doesn’t mean to do that to others but doesn’t realize when he does. I told him he needs to try and be aware of it when talking about things that upset him because that could be the reason people in his life suddenly become upset with him (he’s brought it up multiple times that people will randomly start not liking him and he has no idea why. Usually coworkers) and it made him feel like shit. 

So basically AITA for telling my husband he sounds rude to people when he tells upsetting stories because his emotions spill over?

P.S. he doesn’t seem upset with me for saying it but he was pretty sad in the moment and it had me thinking if I should have even brought it up to him or if it was unnecessary. ",Not the A-hole,0

It all came to a head when T decides to post her feelings on FB(they are one of those couples that share a FB), looking to get sympathy from friends and family while trying to make our mom and my wife look bad( It was one of those poor me/no one likes me posts), which back fires so she starts to accuse people of talking bad behind My brother and her's backs and that were horrible people because we can't let them be happy together and that all we do is talk bad about everyone and that they hope our (my wife and I's kids) end up as horrible as we are. At this point I had enough an cut contact because it wasn't worth fighting a pointless argument. Since then I have gone no contact with them, my wife will get an occasional message about how its my wife's and my moms fault that no one likes them, sprinkled with some name calling but my wife just shows them to me and I just laugh.

Just recently have I found out that my brother and his wife may be homeless, but i have confirmed from multiple people that know him have seen him pan handling where most of the homeless population are at in our city. I have been tempted to drive by and see if he's there to an have a good laugh ( I would be TAH at that point), but AITAH for not caring?",Not the A-hole,0
"My friend 40M recently got a divorce. He was a pain in the ass an extreme cheapskate and lazy person. He and her wife had 3 kids and they were financially struggling a lot. The financial strain was so much that his wife left him and asked for divorce and he said he'll sign the divorce right away but won't pay anything towards the child in future. She agreed to it and they got divorce. 
. Recently we all friends met and i heard him saying how he heard from some mutual friends that his ex wife is financially struggling and even his kids texted him and asked for some money but he refused. I called him out and said he's a total asshole for not helping his own kids. He said that's what his wife agreed upon and it's on her not him and he instead called me an asshole for siding with his ex wife.so AITA?",Not the A-hole,0
"So today morning I was getting ready for school when I over slept and I didn't study for the test I have today so I decided to take a day off but there was a problem. My mom is very strict when it comes to school she likes ny grades to always be the best and she wants me to get into a good college in order to save my family from poverty but my grades have been going downhill recently. 
            Needless to say I am one of the worst students in class and I feel horrible whenever I'm in school so I really didn't want to go today and to make it worse I had to rewrite my computer exams today because I failed so I really didn't want to go today. So I decided that hiding my uniform would be the best idea considering she can't really put the blame on me then but I was wrong she told me that I hid the uniform and that I'm doing this so that I can skip the exam (she doesn't know that I'm rewriting it and that I failed)",Asshole,1
"I recently decided to cut out all the toxic people in my life, and one of them is my JNSIL. I am sick of every one around her enabling her, while also being blamed for her own B.S.

I made it clear that if my husband still wanted to see JNSIL, IDC, but I don't want either me or our children around. The first event, Easter, was easy for husband to make an excuse for my absence; I was about ready to pop, AND my Grandma had just died. I told him, so long as he dealt with it, IDC what he said about my absence on Easter. But... EVENTUALLY he is going to have to say something...He asked me what he should say about me going no contact, and basically I said it wasn't my problem anymore and he was going to have to figure it out.

This gender reveal is the second event. I told him no, we're not going, and please don't leave me alone with our newborn on MOTHER'S DAY...I said 'you need to tell her why, since this is VERY obvert selfishness for once, and take the opportunity while you can. I told him to say something like 'if you want us there, you are going to have to do it on another day.' I thought this was short and concise, and put the blame where it belongs (her) for our absence, while still allowing her a way out...(changing the date). Perfect right? I thought he understood and agreed, but then he him hawed on the text for about ban hour before saying done.

INSTEAD of FINALLY calling her out, my husband blamed our newborn, claiming we are currently not engaging crowds, and we were just spending mother's day as a family.' That's not the truth...and makes it impossible for us to plan with other family... He says because my Grandma died a week before my birthday, and 11 days before our baby was induced, he thought that we could have a real celebration on Mother's day, since we didn't do anything for my birthday, and was just running around preparing for baby in the midst of my grandma's passing. 

I am pissed...even when it is clearly her fault...he chooses to circumvent any confrontation, and additionally is trying to make me be happy by buying me off. This is not a new problem either (buying me off is new, he must have realized before I got mad he was already in trouble, lol...)...but I can't do anything because it's not my place. I feel powerless, unheard, and unseen. I thought going no contact would make me things better, but I STILL have to deal with this crap...since it hasn't actually been dealt with.

Where I may be the asshole, the fact I told hubby to deal with it however he want...and still get mad, possibly making me controlling or petty. The way I see it, the problem really is: my husband ISN'T dealing with the problem, which has been the ENTIRE problem between us and JNSIL...

So AITA? I seriously can't believe this is happening, my JNSIL really did a stupid...and despite going no contact, her shit is STILL affecting my marriage...I am tired of feeling badly about this, so let me know once and for all AITA!!???",Asshole,1
"*Title messup…meant to put rights*

I (16f) have two very mixed families. At my dad’s I have a younger stepbrother (he’s practically my brother) and two younger half-siblings under 6yo. At my mom’s, there’s me and then my stepdad’s three children(13f, 11f, 9m). I am the oldest living in both houses. (Mom and dad have been separated for 7 years, mom remarried for 4, dad remarried for 6). At my dad’s I am not given any repercussions for helping/guiding my younger siblings. But when I do it at my mom’s their dad gets absolutely pissed at me and tells me to leave them alone. 

My mom does NOT like his kids at all. And he assumes I hate them as much as she does. I DO NOT. I don’t mind them when they aren’t being rude or extremely loud at 6:30am. He expects me to babysit whenever without payment or being asked. I am expected to clean up after him, his children, my mom, and myself. And I’ve been asked to treat them the same as my siblings at my dad’s house. (My mom really hates everyone at his house and dislikes that I’m happier there). With all this said, I am not allowed to discipline or have any authority with the kids (I’m not saying I want to parent them…because I don’t, I just want to be treated like the big sister who has a little bit of influence when it comes to those things).The kids often treat me horribly unless they want something from me. AITA for wanting respect and to be treated like the big sister when I’m taking on the role anyways??",Not the A-hole,0

"Writing on phone. Apologies. Me 33f and husband 35m married for 3 years now. We have a baby boy 1m. I come from a well to do family and I always wanted to marry into a nice big happy family as mine. My husband portrayed his family as such and they all played along.

FF post marriage, I note things are diff. SIL only involves his family when she wants something. She evn had been pushy about DH getting money from my family.

My mil passed on during c***d. His sister made all the med decisions without DH. I felt bad to see how the sister was more interested in power play then love for mother. 

After, SIL tried to play mil role in my life. Eg: she would dictate how my pregnancy&amp;delivery should be. I kept silent for my husband’s sake. 3 days after I gave birth was my birthday,she texted me, I said thank you. Then she video called DH and wanted to speak to me. I was in no position to speak so he told her I was showering. She made a big deal of that demanding she be respected. 

BG-Im fr a diff country let’s say US. I married DH in US. I understand he is fr India, and I’ve tried my best to blend in. But SIL is a bully. She has in many instances spiteful&amp;instigate DH. She guilt trips him all the time complaining I don’t do “enough” according to her definition of “enough”. DH married here to a non India, we both are working here&amp; making our lives here, I don’t see why SIL is imposing her India “culture” on to me. And basically her culture seems often tailor made to satisfy her authoritative needs. 

Recently, she sent me a text asking how am I. I didn’t know,my phone was charging. Couple of mins later, she textsDH and complaints I’m being rude ignoring her. DH finally allowed me to confront her directly. I texted asking why fke concern if she wants to complaint. She ranted about demding respect&amp; blocked me. She and her husband called my husband and used abusive words. DH took my side. But now months later, he is saying I was too harsh with SIL. Also, SIL has suggested ‘reset’ this rship&amp;he is pushy for me to agree. He is guilt tripped that he has only his sis&amp; dad left after his mom. I am much aware he is jelous of the bond my family has, we are selfless to each other and very close knit. 
I am so tired of fighting about this with him often. I pointed out to him, he demands my family to treat him like god but he expects me to suffer in his family. His defence, his sister is uneducated so I should make the sacrifice&amp; keep her happy so that he doesn’t have issues. 

He refuse to go therapy anymore as he claims he is fine and I am the problematic one. I told him I will leave this marriage if she is dictating the terms. He called me an AH for giving up on our marriage and subjecting my son to a bad life because of my attitude. I love my son but I feel DH is being unreasonable. But maybe I am not seing his perspective as I’m too hurt emotionally and I feel he is biased. So dear all, please tell me AITA?",Not the A-hole,0
"My boyfriend (29M) and I (28F) live together. We have a loving relationship, but favors have become a pain point.

Today he texted me at work to ask if I could handle letting in a serviceman to fix the washer tomorrow (Thursday). The washer mainly works but has been leaving lint residue on some clothes, it's annoying for sure but I think it's been bothering my boyfriend more.

I texted back ""Is Friday possible?"" and his responses started to get sharp. He said the service company is only available Tuesday and Thursday, that he wanted it handled asap, and asked what my time conflicts were for Thursday. Besides a morning meeting, team lunch and driving him to the airport, I'm admittedly very free in the afternoon. But I was planning to go into the office then (hybrid workplace) for some much needed social time because working from my apt makes me sad lol. I offered to handle the service call tomorrow, see what time window they gave us and then either take it or reschedule depending on if it gave me enough time to go to work (just a 10 mins drive away). Rescheduling to Tuesday is pretty simple because he gets back from his trip on Sunday and he's fully remote so he'd definitely be at home.

Boyfriend called me and we had an explosive fight about how I never say yes to favors for him, that the dirty washer was stressing him out, that he has a mountain of laundry that he couldn't do now, and he just needed a little help. I tried to explain that I was open to Thursday, I was just trying to make it work for me too, and I pointed out that he scheduled this without checking with me first. 

But the conversation went in circles about how I always push back on favors, just like I push back on:

- getting him an ice cream from the kitchen (we're both on the couch, I'm tired too!)
- helping drop his car off at the mechanic of an appointment that he didn't cross with my schedule
- letting him go to a concert he bought tickets for 2 days before because it was on our last day of moving (we didn't finish moving until 10pm that day)

It hurts when he says I don't help him. I try to point out how I've cooked and randomly refilled his water glass and sometimes done his laundry, but it's all so silly and just gets picked apart.

I'm truly at a loss. He said he talked to his parents and a friend, and they said that the concert on moving day would have beeb fine. That was the final straw for me and I said ""so they would be okay with putting the whole move on me?"" and huffed off and now I'm rage typing from my car.

So, AITA for pushing off fixing the washer?",Not the A-hole,0

I, a (17m) visited my great grandma in the hospital a few months back. She passed a few more weeks later and we are still sorting this stuff out. 

Story time.
This takes place before her passing. Me and my mother were driving around when my mom got a call from my grandma saying that she found out that my great uncle was found rummaging through my great grandma's house WHILE she was in the hospital getting treatment. When I heard this I was confused. Based off of my memories he was a kind and loving person and would never do this. So this was a major shock to me. My grandmap said that her sister was going into the house to get documents and found him there going through things. 

A few days later, me and my mom went into the house to see if we can find him. He wasn't there but the freezer was ransacked and she was in the hospital still. I know I can't do anything about this but still I knew I had to do something. When she passed, he showed up :/ after the funeral I walked up to him and brought it up and he said, 
""what? How could you accuse me of this?"" 
I said, ""Diane saw you in there."" Diane is my grandma's sister btw. ""I was in there yes but I was grabbing papers"" I knew this was absolute bs because Diane had all the important papers. I kept telling him off until I had small tears in my eyes. I walked out and went home. My mom agreed with me and so did my grandma and Diane. But everyone else thinks that he didn't deserve this, and I was an asshole. I'm can't decide if i should believe them or not so Reddit, am I the asshole?",Not the A-hole,0
I 22 F is friends with 21 F going on 22. The plan was for me to drive 3.5 hours to my friends house to celebrate her birthday.

Four days before I had to drive up to her house I received and unexpected bill I didn’t realize wasn’t paid. I am by no means finically stable and it took me a while to save $400 for her B-Day weekend. The bill I received was going to cost me almost everything I have in my account to pay it off and would leave me almost in the red. In the end I told her what was going on and how I could no longer go. I apologized and told her I’d make it up to her. She replied back saying “it is not okay” and that she understands I can’t control finances but it still “doesn’t make it okay”.

"I (F23) have an older sister (f25) and she was and always will be my dads favorite child.

 I noticed this very young that He always has pictures of her on the wall and as his Desktop background. 

It finally sinks in at one Christmas when I was young. There was a Barbie, actually two versions of it, one with a dog who can eat and Pop and one with a cat who can drink and pee. I adored this Barbie I really, really wanted it and told my parents that I want no other present for Christmas or my birthday (my birthday is right after Christmas), just this Barbie with the Dog.

 I didn't get it, I never got it even tho I wanted it so, so Bad. Well, a few months later, cut to my sisters' birthday. My dad came in late because he had to get an extra present after work just for her. It was the Barbie with the cat. I was devastated and cried the Rest of the Day in my room. It seems dumb to still be sad about this, it was so long ago, but I kinda still am. 


This wasn't the last time something if this occurred. The most resent one was last year. I was at my dads over Christmas and my birthday and I got a keychain (yay) my sister got a neckless, a bottle with a picture of her and her kids and a blanket. Fast-forward to her birthday and she got a Brand New Nintendo Switch with animal crossing. While again, I got to my birthday and Christmas a keychain. 


So this Christmas my dad asked me to visit him again on Christmas because my sister isn't coming (she never does) and He wanted at least one of his girls around. I told him I won't be coming, I will instead spend Christmas with my boyfriend and his mom and little brother. He asked why I don't want to spend time with my family and I told I will spend with my family who appreciate me and won't favorites one over the other. He asked what I mean and told him to think about it.

" My (42F) daughter (17F) used to be an a+ student. In grade 8, she got A's in most of her academic classes. The only class where she got a B was French, but that was mainly because her French teacher was an asshole. She got into the IB program and she was my little star. I had high hopes for her. She was always hardworking and went above and beyond.

Now, things changed. In grade 11, the first year of IB, she slacks off. She procrastinates over everything. She is barely passing French class, and her overall average is okay in the B's, but I doubt that she'd be able to keep it. She is especially struggling and is falling behind in French, math, and chemistry. Before, I had high hopes that she would be able to get into the medical field. Now she'd be lucky if she is even able to make it into college.

My husband (47M) and I keep telling her that she should work harder and we're disappointed in her, considering that she is now going backward and to stop wasting time. She keeps saying that she would get better, but at this point, she sounds like a broken record. We are now thinking that letting her go into IB was a big mistake and she should leave the program next year.

My daughter has been receiving tutoring sessions for math and chemistry in order to boost her grades. However, we have not seen an improvement and we are spending so much money for hers along with her brothers' tutoring sessions. This evening, we had a discussion with that that we would limit 5 tutoring sessions per week to 2-3 so we can meet a budget. She agreed.

A few hours after the discussion, I found her in the basement with her brothers. I asked her what she was doing, and she didn't say anything. I got mad and told her that I will no longer pay for her tutoring sessions until she starts to take her studies seriously. I told her that she chose to get into the program in the first place and she can go slack off, get terrible grades, and waste her life for all I care, but she will not be getting our money for her studies if she is not willing to put in the effort herself. She begged me and told me that she will start taking it seriously, and I said that until then, she is on her own. My husband called me and I was really frustrated and he said to ignore her.

Long time lurker, first time posting. I’m not in the USA. I have BPD so I’m not sure if I’m overreacting/emotional or if I’m justified so I’m looking here for some help as I can’t get a hold of any family to ask. My mind is a little bit muddled so I’m sorry if it’s a bit jumbled.

Today I(25f) had to take my 4 month son to the doctors for some cream. I couldn’t get into his normal doctor so I booked an appointment with the first available. After getting his script, I asked the Dr some questions about how my son positions his arms. 

After checking the muscle tonnage in my son’s arms, he bent down and stood my son up on the ground. Now, I don’t mean to sound rude but the Dr was on the larger side and due to this, he didn’t exactly have a good grip on my son’s sides. He was more gripping my son’s onesie. When he went to lift him up, my son went from standing upright to being horizontal, to being on an angle and smacking his face on the ground. The dr pulled him up after a few seconds and then said “oh sorry buddy”. I don’t like confrontation, and honestly, I was in too much shock to say anything so I didn’t. I just grabbed my son and comforted him. Maybe this was an accident? 

The second thing that happened that left me feeling a bit… icky? (I honestly don’t know how I feel) was when I was talking about my son’s sleeping bag, he didn’t really understand what I was talking about so I grabbed my phone to show him. As I was scrolling through the photos, I noticed he was watching. When I showed him the photo of what I was talking about, he grabbed the phone out of my hands to maybe have a better look? I have an iPhone and the photo was enlarged.

This was fine, what I did have a problem with was that after a few seconds, I saw that he was scrolling through my photos. I could see his finger swiping for what would have been at least a minute and a half. As he was scrolling, he said something about life before kids and then “as soon as you have kids, your phone is full of baby photos”. 

After he handed me back my phone, the photo was a completely unrelated photo to what we were talking about. I got out as quickly as I could and once I got into the car, I just felt uneasy. My reasoning for the post is, I want to know if I WBTA for writing a complaint against the dr? My son smacking his head could of been an accident, but I’m unsure about the photos? I feel guilty because he is a nice dr but everything else that happened, just makes me feel uneasy and I’m unsure if it’s justified or not.",Not the A-hole,0
"For reference I'm 20, my niece is 4, and My sister is 26.
 
For the last couple months or so, at least a few times a week, My sister will leave the house after putting her daughter down for bed.

For a bit of context as to why I'd feel bad about this, my sister doesn't get a whole lotta time for herself. And usually goes out at night to be with this guy she's seeing. But at the end of the day I feel like I'm doing a favor, and my niece just isn't my responsibility as much as I love her.

"Me(39M) and my fiancé(35F) have been dating for 3 years, and both have children from our last partners. I have a daughter (16,) she also has a daughter (12.) Now, a couple weeks ago I was given a pretty big pay raise at work, and decided to send my daughter to a private school in our city. After talking to my ex-wife, we decided that I would pay half and she would pay the other. She was excited as it was the school she herself attended when she was younger. 

My fiancé though, was not happy. She said that we should let her daughter go to the same private school as well, and that I should pay half. I told her that I doubt that my stepdaughter would even want to go there in the first place (my daughter is more goal/work oriented while hers is a social butterfly who doesn't put much notice on school.) I said that knowing her daughter (we have a great relationship,) it would be very stressful for her to move schools and there really was no point. My daughter has dreams of becoming a surgeon and this specific school would allow her to explore that possibility more. 

Besides this, I said I could pay 1/3 of the tuition, while she and her ex payed the remaining amount. My stepdaughter goes to her dads house during the weekends and as far as I know, they're very close. Judging by his house (I've been there a couple of times picking her up,) he and his wife are definitely well off and wouldn't face financial issues. My fiancé said she doesn't want to ask him and that I should be paying the full half since it was my idea. 

I told her that we should ask the actual subject of discussion, AKA her daughter. I called her in the room, asked, and as I though, she replied with ""no."" She has a lot of great friends in her current school, and is fully satisfied with her lifestyle. My fiancé asked her to think about it more, while glancing at me with an annoyed grimace. 

Even after this, my fiancé still wants to send her daughter to the school, while having me pay half. She says it would benefit her daughter more then she knows. Now she is acting cold towards me around the house, and I'm not sure what to do.

"I (17f) live with my mom, stepdad and three younger half siblings 10m, 8f and 7m. My stepdad also has two sons who are in their 20s. My dad died when I was a toddler and his family have been a huge part of my life and have kept his memory alive for me in a way my mom was no longer comfortable doing after she remarried. My paternal family also spoil me a little. My grandparents have a savings account for me that my dad started. They have bought me stuff when my mom and stepdad were struggling. And the whole extended family have told me I always have a place with them if I ever need it.

So my stepdad's ex wife and her family have been nice to my half siblings over the years. Sometimes they even bought them stuff and extended the offer for access if his sons were doing stuff with their maternal side. My paternal family have never. I don't see anything wrong with that. It makes sense to me even. They're not super close to my mom and I'm their grandchild, not my half siblings. I don't see it as something they should do.

My mom and stepdad have always been bothered by it and have allowed my half siblings to expect it. At Christmas when I went to spend some time with my extended family the oldest of my half brothers ran out before I could and asked that he and the others be included and adopted into the family. He said he wanted them to be their family too. My grandparents were the ones who picked me up and they had no words. I ran my half brother back inside. My mom told me it was a fair question. My stepdad has tried more than once to sever that kind of access with them. But my mom knows grandparents rights would be granted if they cut us off, and she also knows I would never forgive her if she tried. I told her not to make me choose because that would be enough to make her not like the answer.

I told my mom and stepdad they need to explain to my half siblings that they're not entitled to be included. They refuse. And so when my half siblings whined a couple of weeks ago I told them straight. My family are not their family, they are not obligated to include them and they need to stop because it will never happen. They were so upset.

"I am a male college student and with that comes hookups and cutoffs. I spent a little time with this girl and now she's pressing me for her stuff back. I'm cool with that because it's hers. However, I also want to return things that she gifted me. 

To fully understand the situation you have to know that I am horrible with boundaries. With that being said, I often end up in situationships and this was one of them. 

The problem is that I want to return a game, hoodie, and other items (all gifted). I know I'm not obligated to but my friends are arguing for me to keep those items. Tbh I'm pissed off because I don't want those items. Yeah it might reminds me of her and that's just one reason for getting rid of it. But It's my own decision, like I'm not going to sit down one day and say ""damn I should have kept that hoodie"" like wtf. I love them so much but sometimes it confuses me...like it's my decision if I want to give a gift back and I should be able to. So AITA to be mad at them for arguing why I should keep gifts?!

Update: Most people are asking for me to donate the items and I agree with that. However, in the discussion I had with my friends it was argued that I should keep the items. Since I don't want to keep them donating sounds good.",Asshole,1
"So my wife has also been the sort of person who sees helping someone as being owed afterwards and will help on her terms. She now does this with pur toddler (3) when she asks for help its either I will do it after I have finished this drink or sending this WhatsApp, or if she does help she will say I will only help if you do this this and this for me.  I told my wife helping our toddler shouldn't be conditional she needs to know of she asks for help we will be there and not conditional on something.

"I (27F) met my SO Chris (28M) shortly after I moved to Texas from the West Coast for work.  We've been together for about two years and are talking about getting married.

I will admit: I have a dream proposal.  Ever since I was a little kid, I wanted to get proposed to at a baseball game.  My family and I have been huge Giants (San Francisco) since before I was born.  Heck, maybe since my grandfather first came to the US.  I've always wanted to have my proposal at Oracle Park.  Even if it's in the parking lot, I'll be happy.  I've always wanted to share my love for America's pastime with the people I love.  

Chris doesn't share in my love for baseball, but that's okay.  He likes hunting, which I hate.  But whatever. 
 Couples can have separate interests.  No big deal.

Recently, Chris asked if we could do something else for the proposal.  He says he understands how much a baseball game would mean for me.  But he wants to do something else.  

He wants to propose at Thanksgiving with his family present.  My family could be there if they wanted to, but Thanksgiving his his mom's favorite holiday and she tends to go overboard.  It's because his grandmother isn't doing so well and she wants to see one of her grandkids get married before she goes.  This is fine and good, but they haven't always been happy about their son dating a girl like me.

To give you an idea, Chris and his family is white.  Chris' last two girlfriends were blonde, blue-eyed SMU graduates who attend the same church as them.  I'm Filipina, brown, from San Jose and hella Catholic.  Chris' grandma was especially disappointed so see that her son was dating a girl like me and has whined about her golden boy not having ""babies like him"".  I've brushed it off as being old and not adjusting to the way things are.  

Well, Chris and his mom really want to make Thanksgiving memorable this year by having Chris propose to me at dinner.  All to make someone who thinks I'm not worth dating her grandson happy.  

Chris has a brother and two cousins, but I guess their marriages don't count to them.  

I told Chris that I needed to think about it.  It's not that I won't have the dream proposal at  Oracle Park that upsets me.  It's that we're starting off this new chapter in our lives to make someone else happy.  Someone who has been passive agressive about me.  And has said that she didn't think Chris and I would have cute babies together.  And probably wishes that Chris was still with one of this SMU exes.  

He's been distant with me since then and his mom has been ignoring me.  His sister, Kay, has been a lifeline.  She straight up told me that they're upset that their grandma will die without seeing us married.  Then added that I didn't have to do this for her since she's made me miserable.  But that's the facts.  

I'm still adamant that I don't want a Thanksgiving proposal.  Not to make her happy.  But I can tell this is really pissing Chris and his family off.  AITA?",Not the A-hole,0
"Me 25M and friend is 28F

Background info: I was raised with english mastiffs and tibetan mastiffs so I have some knowledge of the breeds, do's and don'ts.

My friend came to me 13 months ago with questions about giant breeds. She had bought a show type tibetan mastiff. For those who don't know, they are bigger and fluffier than your working kind tibetan mastiff. And therefore also have more health problems.

I told her some do's and don'ts.

Fast forward to the dog being 10 months old and it already has severe hip and elbow dysplasia. This is arhtritis. Her dog can barely walk because she overexercised it and made it walk 5 flights of stairs every day in her apartment building instead of taking the elevator. And just this past week the dog had to be put down because it got bloat and a twisted stomach. Again something that could have been avoided had she not fed it and then forced it to go out and exercise right after. Not to mention how the dog was chronically matted.

She put up a post on IG and TikTok asking for money to cover the medical costs so that she could buy a new tibetan mastiff. So I simply told her that she's a horrible pet owners and why she was and that people not donate to her. A lot of people agreed with me, but now our common friends think that I am right but that I went too far for outing her. AITA+",Not the A-hole,0
"This happened a while ago, but people won't leave the subject alone and I'm starting to feel guilty about it.

When my grandmother was going to get married, she invited her girl friend Dotty (fake name) to be her bridesmaid, but the sister of her fiancee at the time didn't liked her and secretly went to her house to uninvite the girl. To make up for the offense, when I was born my grandmother promised Dotty that she would be my bridesmaid when I grew up.

Fast forward 20+ years, I am ready to get married and we are planning the wedding when my grandmother brings up this agreement. 

At first I laughed because I couldn't believe it was serious. It sounded completely nuts to plan something like that when I was like 6 months old and expect me to just accept it. But when I realized it was serious for them, I promised to think about it.

I talked to my fiancee and he asked me what I wanted to do about it. I said I really like Dotty, I know her personally and she used to take care of me when I little, but that the whole thing was strange and I would rather have my own friends as bridesmaid. 

We thought about inviting her and someone older to keep her company, but that was when The Virus ™ hit. Due to limit of guests, we decided that there was no way we could invite someone we really didn't wanted just to keep her company in the party and it was the perfect excuse to not do what we already didn't wanted to. 

When I told my grandmother that, she forced me to go to Dotty's place and personally tell her that I didn't wanted her as bridesmaid. I did so in the most delicate way I could and even told her she could have any other role she wanted. She was sad, I could tell, but I said she could still go to the wedding and handed her an invitation. She decided not to go and gave us a wedding gift (two bedroom kits who were really nice and a tea set that appeared to be sitting in her house for a long time, but that we appreciated anyway). 

To me it looks like everything was much better than I was expecting. But after the wedding,  she was still complaining to my grandmother and badmouthing us lmao. To her credit, grandma told her to stop with that immediately.  But she still complains and cries once in a while,  and I don't know anymore.

Both my sisters bio and both the stepkids are going to be paid a lump sum when they turn 20 that my parents had saved for them. My sister is aware the money exists, she knew from our parents. She is also aware I am overseeing it until they are old enough.

My sisters first husband died many years ago. Her first husband's family are still active in her bios lives. At Christmas they were made aware of a large savings account for both of them that was added to by both her late husband and the grandparents. This appears to be a very large sum of money. Not sure just how much bit it was enough to rattle my sister and her husband because this puts them at a huge advantage compared to their stepsiblings, who never had any relationship with their mothers extended family or their mother.

My sister asked me to put her bios money from our parents into the trusts for her stepkids, so that way they have it somewhat evened out. I said I wouldn't feel right doing that. She told me I have the power to do it and it's in my hands. I told her I would follow the instructions left by our parents and would not change anything.

We had even planned to be in each other's weddings whenever the time came. Fast forward to his wedding. His wife decided she did not feel comfortable with me being in the wedding so he cut me out and never even told me untik I realized I didn't even get an invitation. I was extremely hurt and decided I didn't want him in my life any longer.

I had asked my mother to take him off of our phone plan because I found it extremely weird considering we no longer communicated and he was married to someone completely different. He has no reason to be on the plan any longer, I thought. She kept brushing off me asking, and it's been literal years. I got mad and told her I would even pay his disconnection fee. She said ""It isn't that weird. He pays it and we still talk."" So I told her I would find a new phone provider with my now current fiance.

I been considering posting this because I feel bad for this incident.

First of all, I work in a hospital as an intern, besides the medical and manual work, we have a lot of paperwork to do, in the past few days she didn't do it to the point has gotten into my nerves. 

One day when she wanted to hangout with other interns (one of the interns is getting married so they wanted to go to see dresses), so for the ""friendship"" I did the tasks and let her do her hair and makeup, even leaving early (even before the future bride), without her helping me to finishing the tasks I had to leave late because of that.

The other day she was resting, putting on makeup and chatting, I tell her that there were a few documents to add to an expedient and ask her to do it, while I was checking the x-ray of one patient and checking the papers for a hospital transfer of other patient, she didn't do it and the next day she said why I didn't put those documents in the expedient. I get mad at that too

I been trying to be a good mate and all when she have to stay 36 hour (for the medical guards) I let her sleep and take a shower while I do the tasks, so she can rest. 

The past Friday was my guard so I ask her if she can take some photos of the labs and send them to the group (for the doctors), while I taked a shower, she didn't do it, I asked her why and said that she was felling sick (for what I heard she went to a party, drank alcohol and eat a chocolate cake, she is allergic to it), and I said that even she fell bad she could take the photos and rest, I could finish the other tasks.

"So for a little background, I’m convinced my husband has a food addiction that hasn’t been diagnosed. Food, sweets especially, are not safe around him. Some examples: I made a pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving and he ate 3/4 of it within a day. He will eat the chocolate covered cashews I buy for myself even though he is mildly allergic and it will make him sick. He ate the entire box of chocolates my mother got me for Christmas in one day. Even stuff that is hard to get that I buy for myself will be eaten. Back in March we began a weight-loss journey together (he is considered obese). I have lost 37lbs. He is the same weight. 

So I have taken to hiding the stuff I buy. I still buy the stuff because I want it and I don’t think it’s fair to deny myself a treat every now and then. Well earlier this month I had surgery and had to stay off my feet. While he was taking care of everything, he found my hiding spot. He became very upset to find that I’ve been hiding food from him. I tried to gently explain why, and that made him more upset. He says since we’re married, everything is 50/50 so I don’t have the right to deny him. Needless to say, everything I have hidden has been eaten. 

So, AITA for keeping food bought from our joint account from him? I feel like I may be because I’m not just doing it for his health, I’m doing it because I don’t get anything if I don’t and I feel that’s a little selfish.",Not the A-hole,0

Anyway, he also loves math so much and is very good at it (He's in CS college now so he needs it a lot I think) and he is disabled and chairbound.

So anyway, we were watching TV and he was solving some math problems. He couldn't find a solution and he was so frustrated.

I told him ""That's ok, Issac, you might not be Steven Hawking. But guess what? You are MY Steven Hawking"" and kissed him.

He was then so surprised and started tearing up ""Anna, I told you to stop this""

I told him ""Babe, it's just a joke, I didn't mean to make fun of your intelligence or anything""

He then yelled ""Anna, I TOLD YOU TO STOP IT, stop it, stop it...and you didn't stop at all! This was a disgusting joke and I don't wanna hear it anymore, I don't want to hear it anymore ANNA""

I genuinely don't get it. I called him Steven Hawking, a very intelligent person!

He was so mad that he got in his chair and stormed off, I think he was crying a bit too. I asked my friends and they said that what I said wasn't even a joke, it was just ""stupid"" and ""assholish"" since he's in a chair.

But Steven Hawking is a very great and intelligent man, I was complimenting him so I don't understand.

"I (26F) am back living at home after moving back right before the pandemic. I don't have a ""real"" job (according to my parents, I do digital art as well as stream and consider these my job). I pay rent ($500 per month), buy my own groceries and necessities. I don't drive, and once a week if that, ask my dad for a ride, but usually go when my mom goes in to shop for the house. I mention this as it does bring tension on their side.


I eat dinner that they prepare. I think the last time I complained was some time in my early teens. If I don't want dinner, I let them know, and I prep something using my own groceries. Recently (2.5yrs ago), I developed an allergy to salmon (and my mother suddenly was no longer deathly allergic to salmon, pretty sure there's some witchcraft).


This was the first time I've been severely allergic to a food, and it's scary to me, so near the beginning of it, I would raise a bit of a stink when they would prep my food in the same pan, so I told them that I would prep my own meals when they had it, not a big deal to me at all.


Cue years of ""oh right, you're allergic!"" Didn't care, I'd just prep my food later on. Well, now I'm on a schedule, so early this year I started asking them to let me know the morning or afternoon of if they plan on eating salmon that night so I could prep myself something to eat, as I start my work at 6PM. They never do.


Today I went to see about dinner, to see no prep. I ask my dad, ""is it fend for yourself tonight?"" To which he responds, ""it is for you, we are having salmon,"" that's fine, but I'm a bit annoyed. I have no groceries (leaving for a bit, didn't want to waste). I say (my dad (68) has a short fuse, I made sure I had 0% annoyance in my voice), ""okay, I'd really appreciate if you guys let me know in the morning or afternoon if you're having that so I can prep myself something else.""


This set him off. He yells, ""FOR CHRIST SAKES I'M NOT YOUR CHEF"" it was so sudden I was just.. shocked. I didn't respond, and quietly tried to finish what I was doing so I could go to my room. I have mental health issues and I didn't want to piss him off more and ruin my night (quite easy to do when yelling). My mom came home, and noticed something off, so she asks, and I tell her. Before I could finish, he starts yelling about how I ""didn't want"" salmon, and ""I'M NOT YOUR CHEF,"" again. I'm prob TA here. I started yelling over him that I never said I wanted THEM to prep, I said so *I* could prep me something. He kept yelling he isn't my chef &amp; it isn't his responsibility. I yelled that I don't need to be yelled at, &amp; walked away.


I know I shouldn't have yelled, and I can prep my own dinners all the time, but I am thankful they let me eat dinner with them as it's difficult to save after rent. I don't feel the need to complain when asked to prep food for the fam or myself, it's just this ONE thing.

I sent him a proposal of the work to do be done, with a clear establishment of the level of service he could expect.  He needed a rush job, and I agreed to do the work tomorrow.  He gave me the go ahead via e-mail this morning.  I started the work, and am about an hour in, when I get an e-mail from the client.  He had contacted a competitor and they agreed to do the work for half as much.  The thing is, they are known to undercut competitors and offer a lower level of service.  I have e-mailed my client both reminding him that their level of service may not match up, and offering for me to do the job for half for a lower level of service, and also reminding him that I have already started and worked an hour.

" I recently went through a messy breakup getting out of an extremely toxic relationship. Over the past two months, my friends have been supporting me through the healing process. I'm definitely feeling better, but there's no doubt that I am still extremely traumatized and probably need therapy from the whole thing. It was bad.

Two of the friends who have been the most supportive to me recently got in a relationship. They've both been really great to me and I'm thrilled that they're happy together, but a part of it hurts. I know that they're not trying to rub it in my face that they're happy and I'm not, but when they're constantly cuddling and holding hands when it's just the three of us together, it really feels like that. Not to mention seeing them like that makes me miss what I used to have, when that's definitely not something I should be feeling right now. All the little displays of affection I see from them just remind me of what I used to have - memories I've been working on repressing. And I know it's selfish of me to think like this, but them being in a relationship ultimately puts me in second place for both of them, a position I'm all too used to being in. Them being in a relationship makes it so they're both prioritizing each other over me. Obviously I don't expect them both to prioritize me over everyone else, but I wanted us all to like each other equally, instead of me being forced further down both their priority lists.

I know that they both genuinely support me since they've spent the past 2 months dealing with my bullshit, but something about this just makes it feel a little less genuine. Since they've gotten together, I've had no one to talk to since they spend all their time and energy on each other, and I feel alone, which sucks since I'm still mid-healing and I have no support system now.

"For context, I (29F) have a son who’s about to turn 4 in a few weeks. My partner and I intend to take him to a planetarium, which is something he’s wanted about for as long as he could talk about it. It seems the stars are finally aligning, lockdown wise, and we can finally afford to make his little dream come true. The only catch is, my mother (49F) also has a young child, (6F) and my little sister gets super excited about birthdays and feverishly wants to attend them. In the reasons of fairness, my son hasn’t cared for birthdays before this year, but he seems excited for this one - all without knowing what we might be planning for it. 

When I extended the invitation for my mother to join us, she said I’m an AH who is not considering her and my little sister’s feelings or interests or plans and by choosing to do “that activity” for my son’s birthday, I’m secluding them from attending the event. The planetarium is three hours’ drive away in another city and she cites this in her reasoning, along with “we should look at what else we can do there because sister doesn’t enjoy that”. Both my parents drive while I would be taking a train to get there. 

When I said that’s unfortunate and suggested we could do something another weekend together, she buckled down and told me I should take my son there on his birthday since I’m so particular about it but tell him his “real” birthday will be the one on the day they’ll get to attend. 

Now, I’m sure other broke single parents have had to readjust dates for their babies’ birthdays and took advantage on them being too young to get called out on it, but I firmly don’t want to do that now that I have no need for it other than to placate another adult. I want my son to spend his birthday doing something he actually wants and I want him to know we planned this trip for him on his birthday, to make him happy. 

AITA for making this an unreasonable hill to die on, according to my mother ?

EDIT: Thank you all for reaching out and for the outpour of support. I’ve taken a great many things on board and despite realising I’m not in the wrong, I still felt bad and wanted to find a way to fix this. 

Unfortunately despite taking the time to formulate my thoughts correctly and go with someone’s suggestions of trying to comfort my mother’s insecurities and/or abandonment concerns, while keeping the boundary intact, the situation still exploded in my face. 

I explained I’m going to take my son to the planetarium with just my partner, and suggested we visit a different spot with them and my sister the following weekend, but lo and behold, my mother suddenly wanted to take the three-hour trip after all. This of course turned into a, “oh you’re not inviting us?!” and a massive row. 

I tried my best to explain that it isn’t wrong of me to want to do something with just my immediate family but it was shut down into how “ungrateful” I am and what a terrible daughter she raised. Mic dropped on “never ask us for anything again”. 

I still intend to take my son to the planetarium, and I’m sure he’s going to have a great time. I’ll buy him lots of books and trinkets while we’re there. But I’m honestly heartbroken and haven’t stopped crying yet.

"I work in a bar, during quieter times its normal for customers to chat to me and the other bar staff, especially when they're regulars.  
  
While I was working, a customer was chatting to my colleague and they started talking about me. I wasn't really paying attention so I'm not entirely sure what the lead up to this was, but the customer said ""Yeah but [my name]'s a bit spesh bless him"". I'm not sure if this is a term that's used outside England but its basically slang for ""special needs"". Like, a slightly less offensive way of calling someone the r slur.  
   
Technically speaking, I *do* have ""special needs"" - I have pretty severe adhd and dyspraxia. I also come from a rough background so I'm not the most well educated person in the world (that's something I'm working on). There are certain things I struggle with and I know I'm clumsy and can seem a bit dopey. I'm not stupid - not that I'd deserve to be made fun of even if i was - but I know I can come across that way and it's something I'm insecure about.  
   
I'm not normally confrontational in the slightest so it probably came as a bit of a surprise when I challenged the customer. I don't think I was rude, I asked him to repeat what he said and I asked him why he thought that was an acceptable way to talk about someone. He said it was a joke and he wouldn't have said it if I was *really* ""spesh"". I said that wasn't an excuse, and that i actually do have a disability. He apologised, I thanked him for the apology, he left fairly soon after. It was an awkward interaction.   
   
I thought I was completely reasonable but my colleague said it wasn't necessary to call him out and embarrass him. I've asked others, most seem to think I was within my rights to call him out but that I should have just let it go to avoid making the customer uncomfortable.   
  
The reasons I've been given why it shouldn't be a big deal:  
- ""you make fun of yourself all the time so he probably thought it was fine"" (I think there's a difference between me calling myself a clumsy dickhead and someone I barely know joking about special needs)  
- ""you do have special needs so he wasn't wrong""

Personally I disagree with these reasons but I'm curious how other people feel since I'm aware this is a sensitive issue for me so I'm not exactly impartial. AITA for embarrassing the customer?",Not the A-hole,0
"I have a condition called impacted earwax, caused by swimmers ear. For some reason, my whole life, it’s come back, and me having ears really sucks. Essentially, I have wayyy too much ear wax. I need to clean out my ears daily just so they aren’t in pain. They’re still uncomfortable, unfortunately. 

Well, my older brother, Sebastian, has a fiancé, Tina, and they live in a room in our house that my mom rents to them. The other day, I guess Tina realized just how much I clean out my ears, and said, “you really shouldn’t have to clean them out that much, I feel like you’re probably over exaggerating a little just for attention.” I told her I wasn’t, and she said, “Okay, well, I guess that your poor little ears are reason enough to waste money on q-tips so often.” I know it was petty, but I said, “okay, I’m gonna go for 2 weeks without cleaning my ears. And every day, you have to take a picture of the inside of each, and see what happens.” 

And so her pact with the devil was made. We didn’t make it past 5 days before she said, “okay, you made your point, you ass.” My ears were leaking onto my shirt by that point, and the inside of my ears were on fire, because the ear drops I’m supposed to use were just sitting in a puddle of wax in my ears, not doing their job. I thought it was funny, if not a little painful, but my brother and Tina thought it was petty and gross, and now they just call me the “waxy grubby creep.” 

My mom said I did nothing wrong, aside from just being generally obnoxious, but Sebastian and Tina made it into a whole thing and took it way to seriously. AITA?",Not the A-hole,0
"Little context - there were two lines open at the store.  I was in the first line, the lady is in the other line.  Her line was moving slow, cashier had to go to the back for a minute.  I got one guy in front of me.  So now it’s my turn.  As I’m about to go up, the lady in the other line asks if she can go ahead.  She apparently got stuck waiting in the other line before me (not arguing that).  She asked if I minded, I said kinda do.  Just because my line was moving faster does that entitle her to jump lines? She had the audacity to say I wasn’t there first.  If what she said was true, she would be the one at the counter ready to pay.  Aita? Is everyone entitled to jump lines as they see fit?",Not the A-hole,0

My cousin ""Dave""(28m) and i(30f) were close growing up. We used to have a blast planning parties together and seeing them come to life. We did this up until he moved out of state 8 years ago. The last time I had saw him in person was at his wedding 5 months after he moved. Well, Dave just moved back with his wife and their 4 kids(6f, 5m, 3m, and 4month f).

I was beyond excited and invited his family over for a welcome home party. At first things were going great but then his kids started in. When I say they are terrors, I mean I've never seen such wild kids. They ended up destroying my house, terrorizing my cats, hurting my son and knocking over my China cabinet all while Dave and his wife just laughed it off. I ended up spending the party chasing them around and trying to keep them out of trouble. The next party I invited them to was at the park. The police ended up getting called when his kids pushed another kid off of the top of the playground. Dave and his wife didn't even apologize. Yet alone watch their kids. It was at that moment I decided they weren't invited to my house or my parties.

On to the issue. This past friday, I went all out and threw a movie pool party for my son, his friends and my nibblings. I bought small blow up pools and filled them with pillows, hung up a sheet for a projector, hung up lights, threw around 200 glow sticks in the bottom of the pool, set up a snack station, and set up fun little yard games. It was a lot of fun and the kids had a blast(clean up sucked for me tho).

I ended up posting pictures online and my cousin lost his mind. He called me yelling that his kids would have loved to come and I was a crap person for not inviting them. I told him they would have been invited if he could control his kids better. We got into a fight about it. Now the rest of our family is saying I was qrong and the kids should have these experiences.

"First time posting and in mobile so sorry for the format. 

I want to know if I WBTA if I did not attend my sister in law's baby shower. 

My sister in law announced she was pregnant in late July, I have struggled with infertility but was happy for her. 

Late August me and my boyfriend had found out we were expecting and we were over the moon excited. 
Unfortunately in October we were told our baby had no heart beat and I had a D&amp;C.

Now my sister in law lives 2 hours away from us and the rest of my boyfriend's family. And the baby shower is being held the 2 hours away. My boyfriend's mother and his other sister do not drive. 

I feel going to the baby shower will absolutely tear me apart knowing that I should also be planning my baby shower and getting ready for my baby. I just don't think it's something I can emotionally handle. But the thing is, if I don't go my MIL and other SIL will not be able to go if I do not, due to not driving. 

TLDR; WIBTA for not going to my SILs baby shower after having a miscarriage which also means my MIL and other SIL cant go to the baby shower?

Edit1: baby shower is Feb 13, just found out about it today, it is assumed I will drive MIL/SIL
we live in a very very small town. Things like Uber and Lyft do not exist.

Edit2: me and my boyfriend talked, he was and always is completely on my side. We have decided that we will drive them in the 2 hours, drop them off, then we will go out for a nice dinner some where and to Walmart (the closest Walmart to us is this 2 hour drive so bonus)",Not the A-hole,0
