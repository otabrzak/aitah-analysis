"This is such a stupid argument but it's stressing me out and because of the situation there's not really anyone irl I can ask.  
  
I've never wanted to have kids, imo I have pretty solid reasons for this. My childhood was f**ked, I've had bad experiences with ""dads"" as a whole and the idea of being one isn't something I can really handle. My mental health is a mess, tbh no one even expected me to still be alive at 30, never mind having kids. I have no problem whatsoever with children, I look after friends' kids regularly, but I don't see myself as ever being dad material.  
  
I had a recent ""pregnancy scare"" after a ONS with an old friend (""Anna""). She was leaning towards keeping the baby which was uhhh quite a lot to process but like I was jointly responsible and if that was her choice I wanted to do the right thing. It turned out that nature kinda made the decision for us - so in theory it's no longer an issue but obvs we're both still feeling weird.  
  
Anna told our mutual friend ""Cassie"" what was happening. Me and Cassie are close, she knows my feelings about being a parent but I'm also one of the first people she asks if her kids need to be looked after. Since this happened, she has been making a lot of jokes about me/my attitude to parenting (e.g. implying I would fake my own death when I found out about the pregnancy, asking how the kid is going to feel when they realise their dad is ""a big hoe"", basically saying I'd be irresponsible/not interested). Me and Cassie have always joked around a lot about things we wouldn't necessarily say to anyone else so this isn't that unusual, tbh though this topic really stings. Yesterday, Cassie asked me how I was doing after Anna lost the pregnancy. I tried to answer seriously, but she was like ""oh well, on the plus side at least you don't have to change your name and start fresh in a new country"". I snapped at her and told her to give it a rest and this turned into a big argument.  
  
She said I should have just said if her jokes bothered me, obviously she wasn't being serious but how was she supposed to know it was a sore point when I never even wanted a kid in the first place, and despite the jokes she was still checking in with me and trying to be supportive (true). From my side, I think it should go without saying that even if I don't kids, I still don't want to hear about what a shit dad I would be and if she actually thinks that, how come she's fine with me watching her kids all the time. Today she texted saying she's sorry if she offended me but how I spoke to her was out of line. I didn't raise my voice or insult her or anything but I was pretty sharp which unusual for me.  
  
I don't think I'm in the wrong but I'm willing to apologise if people think i handled it badly. AITA?",Not the A-hole,0
"For Cinco de Mayo, my girlfriend told me she was going out with some new friends she made at work. There were no plans made for me to join them, which I'm perfectly okay with. 

Come around 5 pm yesterday, my girlfriend texts me and asks if I can pick her up and drive her home since she's been drinking. I gladly agreed and told her I would come get her after I got off work. I end up getting out of the office 15 minutes later than usual, as she calls me right when I'm walking out to tell me where she is. I can tell she's had a few and she says she wants me to come meet her friends and have a beer. I agree and drive to the bar. 

I get to the bar and am introduced to her friends. I have a beer. After about an hour of sitting with girlfriend and her friends I start getting frustrated. I'm not a social person and I don't have much of an ability to warm up to new people - especially a large group,  and especially when most are a few drinks ahead of me.

So I sit for a total of two hours not saying much of anything to the group of friends, and occasionally chatting with my girlfriend. I start getting more and more anxious as I sit, not being a part of the conversation, and being self aware of the fact that I look like an uninterested dick. 

It gets bad enough that I decide to leave before my mood worsens and I become a damper on everyone else's mood. I tell my girlfriend that I want to leave, but she can do whatever - I prefaced that so she wouldn't think I was inferring I wanted her to leave to. She acknowledges it and about 20 to 30 minutes later I leave. Immediately after I leave I text her to apologize, explain I was anxious, and to tell her to call me if she needed me. 

An hour later she responds with a passive aggressive text about me leaving her at the bar drunk. I ask if she's okay and tell her I can pick her up. The rest of the night turns into me trying to make sure she's okay, while she sends sporadic, drunk, passive aggressive texts. It gets to the point in which I am begging her to just tell me she's got someone that can take her home safely, all the while she ignores my calls.

Admittedly, I start going crazy. At first, when she wouldn't respond to me I freaked out and asked her sister to contact her to make sure she was okay.
I spam called and texted since she wouldn't respond to me. 
I tried contacting one of her friends through social media.
I tried asking her roommate if she made it home.


TLDR. I left my drunk girlfriend at the bar because of social anxiety. After, she intentionally ignored my attempts to make sure she was safe.",Not the A-hole,0
"The first thing you need to know is that my grandpa suffers from several medical issues. Without going into too much detail, he needs to take both medication and oxygen regularly. He doesn't like taking his oxygen every day and is always tired because of it. He also must be constantly reminded to take his medication because he doesn't like it. 

Due to the pandemic, both myself (18) and my older brother (19) are staying with my grandparents until lockdown eases up. My brother is also a big worrier and stresses out easily, especially when it comes to family. 

So a few days ago, my brother wakes me up in a panic saying that our grandpa's oxygen is at 83 (for reference, it's supposed to be at LEAST 95. Anything lower than that more than warrants a trip to the hospital). And that our grandpa is refusing to put on his oxygen ventilator. 

I go to our grandpa and essentially give him an ultimatum: wear your ventilator until your oxygen level rises or I call 911 immediately. He chooses to wear it. Later on in the day, while my brother is at work, I sit my grandpa down and explain to him that he HAS to wear his oxygen ventilator every day for at least 30 minutes and that his oxygen should have never gotten that low. He's making my grandma and brother needlessly worry for something that he should be doing every single day. 

Well, he didn't like that. Cue the rant on how I was young and didn't know what I was talking about and how I had no right to scold him on this and how he would do whatever he wanted about his oxygen and such. 

So this is where I'm probably the asshole. I just told him that if he was so adamant on killing himself then he might as well do it faster so my brother and our grandma wouldn't have to watch him the whole while. 

He looked very offended and we haven't really spoken the last few days. He is wearing it more though, so I think I got through to him a bit.

My grandma thinks I should apologize, and my brother hasn't said anything about it so I know he doesn't have a problem with what I said. 

So my question is if I'm the asshole or not for what I said to him.",Not the A-hole,0
"Today at work me(M) and 3 other people were loading trash cans into a dumpster. These are very big and often fairly heavy trashcans, people usually need help with them. After I dumped one trash can, i jumped in to help the next person(F) dump another trash can. After i did this  a second woman told me that i should have asked if the first woman needed help and that it was sexist of me to help her. She didn't sound rude or accusatory, but the first woman had said nothing about it, and i  would have helped the next person regardless of who it was, it's just in my habits. Aita?",Not the A-hole,0
"Yesterday, I started a new job as a Senior Lecturer at a university and the role is a maternity cover.  In the ad and at the interview, they specifically said that I will be teaching on subjects that have to do with my research/Ph.D.; nevertheless, on my first day, they told me that actually, I would be teaching students soft skills like referencing, time management and so on, but not topics within my expertise. 

They also promised me that I would get a laptop as it is a policy for all staff to get one on loan and not only had not actually put in a request for me to get one, and are now saying that it might take up to 4 weeks because there is a shortage (?!). Well, there is no way for me to do any kind of work without a laptop. Besides, everyone is severely disorganized, running around like headless chickens and the department seems to be doing incredibly poorly in terms of how many students actually graduate (which only became apparent after seeing some internal statistics).

I also met the person who is going on leave (that I am replacing) and basically, she said that she intends to come back in 3 months (as opposed to the 12 that they mentioned in the job ad). I asked my line manager about this and he said that the pregnant lady is wrong about just needing 3 months because it's her first child and she will definitely realize she will need more time. I know the past is in the past, but I declined 2 research job offers in order to take this job and only because this one was longer term. 

What truly broke me yesterday is that people kept ferrying me from building to building to meetings that I couldn't contribute because I had no laptop or access to any of the internal files and I didn't even eat or drink water for the whole day. That's why I am looking for advice, I think I need some clarity and outside perspectives. So, Reddit, WIBTA if I handed in my notice next Monday?",Not the A-hole,0
"(24m)My partner and I (21f) have been living together since the beginning of our relationship and he’s always had problem with discipline of walking up in the morning. And always showing up late to events. This wasn’t a big deal to me until I began to be the one to wake him up, and boy is he a fucking monster when he just wakes up, he argues with me and tells me to leave him alone when he knows he needs to be up. He brushes it off as it’s just him in the morning, and apologizes. However recently his sleep schedule has been incredibly off, he either doesn’t sleep because he’s up playing video games or obsessing over his latest obsession. Or he sleeps for 16 hours a day. This caused him to fall back in school where he’s 2 weeks late to turning in an assignment and if he loses his scholarship we could go broke. And he’s not particularly lazy either not entirely Atleast. Last night he fell asleep before me and woke up after me I went to school and came back and he’s still knocked out, he was in such a deep sleep that I was locked out the house. When I came in I encouraged him to get up, that he’s going to waste the day away. He bang to give me a cold shoulder and was being incredibly rude to me saying I shouldn’t have woken him up  even thought our relationship is all about holding eachother accountable. I told him to do whatever he wants and he fell back asleep. He has a class at 3 and homework to do, and to build some furniture but I don’t intend to wake him up for any of it because it’s starting to take a toll on my mental of how he speaks to me when he just wakes up. It shouldn’t be my responsibility to look after someone who is rude to me when I’m just doing my job. AITA for not wanting to help him anymore.


Should also say as far as we know he has no underlying medical conditions. He refuses to go to the doctor, and just stopped drinking energy drinks

I should add he works over night 12-8 but only on Friday night and Saturday night.  He goes to school 3 days a week but 2 of those days it’s online and only 1-2 classes a day",Not the A-hole,0
"So before I begin this story let me give some context for the past 8 months of 2021 I was working hard to finish my degree before September came around and on top of that I had to worry about the debt that would come after so I had told my friends I would be busy and I won’t be able to hangout unless planned accordingly and works with my college schedule for the months that followed and this was at January flash forward to August I have gotten my degree and was lucking enough to pay off my debt with no interest and I was ready to hangout with them ,but before that I was job hunting for a job I studied and worked for. During the time of not hanging out with them I would receive calls and text during class of them wanting to hangout I always refused for the reason that I wanted no distractions unless its my specific day off of work and school. When I would text them if they did wanted to hang out during my day off I would always have a response of “I’m busy” or “I am tired from work” I understood and told them it was alright. Flash forward to august 27 of 2021 at 10:45 I am receiving text to hang out or they’ll threaten to wake my family from sleeping I denied them because I was tired from working all day and they should’ve told me a day before so I would’ve gotten a day for them since I was done with school. Instead of them walking away or saying its alright I get bombarded of text of saying I chose my education over them and that If I was my old self i would go hangout with them. After reading those text I ignored them and they woke my family and they were threatening to call police on them they left after 30 minutes. Or so what I have thought. On the morning of august 28th I have discovered my car has been bedazzled with rhyme stones. I laughed it off until I was removing the gems and have found out the glue from the gems is not coming off my car I did my best to remove them but no budge I had asked a professional to try to remove it and told me it was going to cost around 300 because they had put so much on my car. I was angry until they called me saying someone has bedazzled their cars too. At first i believed them until they sent photos of them gems only on the windows NOT ON THE PAINT OR SMALL INDENTS OF THEIR CARS. I WAS FURIOUS. I was angry they called me a bitch saying i was crying over nothing and they admitted to bedazzling my car for not being true friend to them and bedazzling their windows to make it seem someone did it since they “thought i was really stupid to not think it was them”. Its been 2 weeks since I have talked to them and my car STILL HAS THE GLUE FROM THE GEMS (I’m broke from paying debt all at once). I didn’t want to talk to them for the sole reason of them saying I had anger issues for something small. (The car is a jeep liberty white 2005 I love that car for the reason being that I worked hard for it, It was love at first sight ,and paid it off with my own money) so am I the asshole for being angry at them?",Not the A-hole,0
"I just got a puppy. Originally he was sexed as female, and the shelter given name was Lucy. He replied to it so I kept it. A few weeks later I found out he was a boy, but he already responded to his name, so I jokingly just lengthened it to Lucifer and I call him Luci. He's a GSD/Rottie mix, so he sort of looks like what you'd expect hellhounds to. 

The issue comes in with my father; he is a priest, and has been since I was a kid. He doesn't like dogs anyway. In his opinion dogs are the devils animal. I grew up with cats (as the opposite of dogs they were obviously the opposite of hell, so, heavens animals) and so when they found out I was getting a dog, he prayed for me, yada yada. I never really believed in all the Jesus stuff, and if you ask anyone my dog is named after Lucifer from the show, not the literal devil, because to me he doesn't exist. 

Plus my girlfriend is a witch, so I'm basically as far from Christianity as one can get. 

Anyway, my sister saw a post on Instagram where I used his full name. No big deal. Well, I thought it wasn't. My mom called me, sobbing, saying I'd been preyed upon and I needed to get rid of my dog immediately. After a while I explained he hadn't forced me to give him that name (because he's a dog. All he knows is poop on mom's floor and eat her expensive shoes) and I chose it for him.

Since then they have been begging for me to change it. It's a name, so I'm thinking it's pretty funny. Besides, satanism doesn't sound that bad. 

Jokes aside, it's getting really serious. Like, my dad showed up to baptise my dog kind of serious. I told him to fuck off, and told them they were all blowing it was out of proportion. 

My girlfriend thinks we should just change his name to appease them, and I am thinking we may have to, but I really don't want to. He's my dog, and I should be allowed to name him whatever the fuck I want. 

Am I the asshole? Changing his name wouldn't be that big of a deal, but it almost feels like I'm letting them win again.",Not the A-hole,0
"My sister (47) is an alcoholic. I know right there you might stop and make a decision but it’s more complicated than that. 

She has been in and out of hospital for a year with pneumonia, a zillion COVID tests, and it wasn’t until May that she was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis. This disease causes a hardening of the lung tissue and the person cannot breathe. My sister lives in an illegal room in a rooming house paid for mostly by her BF and his family. Because of her drinking she’s lost at least 25 jobs in recent years and now works at a drug store for 4 hours per week. She brings home around $52 every two weeks and her room rent is $400. She has no car or license or bank account due to a variety of legal troubles from the past. 

Now the landlady is selling her house and BF is leaving her, so she needs to get out of the house at the end of September. She can’t get on disability because she doesn’t have her birth certificate, and we can’t get her one because the state requires the credit card that would pay for a new one to be in the person’s name. She has no credit card, obviously. She also has not even one friend. 

When our mom died in 2009, my sister was drunk through it all, and I took care of everything, paid my mom’s creditors, laid out money for the funeral, the mortgage etc., sold the house and gave her her share (nearly $80K) which she promptly spent or lost.  My dad will not help her now since he’s loaned her money in the past. As an aside, I am a professional with a husband and two kids and I have a middle class lifestyle. I have never loaned her money but she has never asked before. 

I feel she isn’t organized enough to even look for another room, an apartment or a full time job. Rooms in her area that are legal are around $800-900. She is so short-sighted that she has asked me only for a couple hundred dollars. She tells me she spends most of her time crying. She’s missed a bunch of medical appointments because of her drinking and because of the illness itself (she sleeps a lot), so we don’t even know the status of her disease or her treatment plan. Even if I set her up with a security deposit I can’t just pay her rent and her living expenses indefinitely. But I am feeling guilty for not sending her money because she is ill with the pulmonary fibrosis. She also has cirrhosis. AITA?

ETA: my other sister is on disability and so got this sister a case manager. The case manager is stymied by a variety of things including the birth certificate and my sister’s lack of follow through. I appreciate everyone’s suggestions thus far, thank you.",Not the A-hole,0
"My (24F) fiancé (33M) have been together for a couple of years. He and his ex dated for 5 years before calling it off on amicable terms, and have been ‘best’ friends for around a decade total (platonic friends/off-on fwb for 3 years before he met me). They used to FaceTime every day but since we started dating, maybe once a week. She and I have never met, but she’s expressed interest in meeting me when she’s in town. Back when we were new and not official yet, my then-bf asked if we were still non-exclusive. I said yes because I didn’t want to limit him, but let him know I wouldn’t feel too good about it (I should have just said no). He ended up having sex with his ex once while she was in town which hurt and damaged my trust with him, as well as started off a rocky foundation for my ‘relationship’ with the ex. I explained how I felt, he apologized profusely, life moved on and we made it official (bf/gf) not too long after. Time passes and she’s in town again, wanting to meet me again, claiming that it’s important to her since she deeply values her friendship with my fiancé.

Here’s where the drama starts. For background, I have severe social anxiety but have hung out with the friend group that ex and fiancé are part of a handful of times. She planned a party with them but basically gave a conditional invitation to me, saying that she wanted to meet with just us three before to make sure that it would go well and that there wouldn’t be awkwardness emerging at the party stemming from her being an ex and the fact that she had sex with him while we were dating. Time was tight between this sort-of invitation and the date of the party and I felt like I shouldn’t have to cater towards her desires and move around my schedule last minute. She sent a few more messages scrambling to suggest activities to do together but I just had my fiancé let her know I wasn’t attending.

A few days after the party I apologized for not getting back, that I thought it was odd that she needed a pre-meeting, and asked why she even felt the need to meet me and have a positive relationship with me in the first place. She replied while drunk, saying her motivation was that she’d be broken-hearted if she wasn’t invited to the wedding and wanted to meet me because my fiancé is important to her. She went on to say in a really condescending way that she presumed I would be the one with insecurities about the past, and the fact that I’m painfully shy in group settings would be a bad combination. She tried to come off as she was watching out for me, but the way she worded it put the blame on me and was really rude by mentioning my more vulnerable times when I first started socializing with my fiancé’s group. She finished that message by saying she felt her olive branch was rejected by my leaving her on read and not saying anything about the small Xmas gift she had left for me.

"So, here's the story...

My mother (who has personal issues of her own) had told my sister earlier in the year that she was going to knit a blanket for her for Christmas.  At some point, there was a falling out between my sister and my mother.  My sister eventually went as far as disowning my mother.

My mother then gifted the blanket to my son for Christmas.

Shortly after, my sisters and I were chatting in our group chat.  She brought up the blanket and asked me to get it from my mother and send it to her.  I told her that my mother had already given it to my son.

Well, then the shit hit the fan.  She posts on Facebook about how Herod is killing the first born, and that feudalism is alive an well.  I offered to send her the blanket (after speaking with my son about it, and he said he was fine with that), but no...that wasn't good enough.  I had betrayed and hurt her beyond words apparently.

My other sister told me that I should not have even accepted the gift in the first place, since it was for my older sister.  Despite the fact that she and my mother were refusing to speak to each other.  I told her that I had offered to send it back and was told, that wasn't the point.

So, I told both my sisters to fuck off and not to bother me about anything again.

" About a week ago I (17F) was talking to my parents and brother (14M) about switching from cable to streaming services. Where I live cable is extremely expensive and would be cheaper to just have 6 streaming platforms. Besides the only person that still watches TV is my sister (22F). So we decided, without my sister while she was doing a road trip, to do it.
 Yesterday my sister came home and noticed that the cable was gone. She was really angry at me for not telling her that beforehand. 
 Here’s where I might be the asshole: Since I'm the one who came up with the idea my parents told me to tell my sister the “news”. I haven’t talked to her in months due to a fight we had, so I just asked my brother to call her instead (he didn’t).

"EDIT:

Thanks for the enlightment. I did this to get a consensus and learned a lot about line etiquette. I've never complained before to retail workers and wasn't planning on doing so. was having a shifty day so I came hear to let off some steam and got humbled instead. I know the shit they deal with and don't want to fault them bc fedex decides to understaff the place.

And by Karen fit (definitely not the best wording), I meant it as complain for like 5 seconds with a disappointed expression and go on my merry way. Not really go all out yelling and abusing someone. We all make mistakes I would never abuse or yell at a stranger. My perception of a Karen is someone who would complain and give an attitude to a complete stranger unless the stranger was a jerk themselves. So a lot of you people made assumptions there. 

So I Went to ship 2 large packages ~$120 worth in labels, pre labeled and all to a local FedEx. I Waited in line got to the counter put first package down and said I'll be back quickly to grab the 2nd big package. In that time the lady took another customer and wasted 10 mins of my time forcing me to wait for the other customer who they had to do the whole shipping shmeal for. All they had to do was scan the pkg and give me the damn reciept. If I complained in the store and let out a Karen fit WIBTA?

A family member asked us in mid-Jan if we would be able to dog-sit their puppy in March while they are on vacation. The puppy is about 4.5 months old. The dog was still being housetrained, but they felt sure the pup would have it down by the time they left. I  agreed and refused to let them pay me for it. When they brought her over to leave her, however, they mentioned the dog is still having occasional accidents but went on to say that she is mostly fine.

The dog is not mostly fine. At all. She's really bad, like she has never been trained at all. We've been trying to keep up housetraining and nothing is working. She makes poops or pees constantly wherever she happens to be, even if she has just been outside and already gone potty. You can't take your eyes off of her for a second because she will dart off and poop or pee on the floor, so I've been having to keep her in her crate at all times if she is inside the house. I've been trying to get her on a schedule, but the dog is resistant and this is like a part-time job. During the workday, I try to take the dog for potty breaks and work from my laptop in the backyard so that she isn't confined and crying in her crate all day. It is hard to see my screen and get my work done, but I'm trying to make it work. I was honest when they called to check in - that this isn't going very well.

"A little over two years ago, I (19m) had finally saved up the money to buy an expensive bike I wanted (it was well over $6000). I had to miss out on getting a car to afford this bike, but it was 100% worth it. I *loved* this thing; so much so that I ended up giving it a custom paint job inspired by the Mystery Machine from Scooby-Doo. It wasn't perfect, but I'm still proud of what I did. Unfortunately, about a month after getting it, someone stole it. I was taking my bike to the library, and I left my bike on the bike rack. When I left, it was gone. I was absolutely devastated by this. We called the police, but nothing came of that, and I didn't see my bike for another two years.

A couple of days ago, I was driving home from the grocery store. I was taking a detour through a neighborhood like I usually do when I saw a kid, maybe 14 or 15, riding by on what I recognized immediately to be my bike. I tried to talk to him, but he ignored me, so I followed him for about 2 minutes to his house. I walked up to the house and rang the doorbell, and the boy's father opened the door. He asked me what I was doing, so I explained that my bike had been stolen two years ago, and that he was in possession of it. I showed him pictures of my bike from back when I had it to prove that it was my bike. He told me that he bought the bike for his son's birthday from the bike shop a couple of months ago, and that unless I had solid proof that the bike was mine (which I unfortunately did not have, even though the bike was clearly mine), he wasn't obligated to give it back to me.

I yelled something like, ""how many bikes have you seen that look like the f\*\*king Mystery Machine? Just give me my bike back, asshole!"" I was loud enough for the kid to notice, and he came down to ask what was going on. The dad told me that he would be willing to sell it to me, but that unless I had solid proof, he would not give it.

Now: she told me she would help me pick out clothes for the trip.

She didn’t look up for a good five minutes, and by that time any motivation I had to keep going kind of went out the window. 
So here’s the question: 
I asked her to give me time to sit and get back into the right headspace before we continued. She promptly walked into another room and slammed the door. 
AITA for asking for that time?

Edit: I used weird phrasing here. I was getting distracted and needed to bring my focus back. 
Also: my therapist had suggested she help me with this since it was causing me to panic over and over again. So she had agreed to help me.",Asshole,1
"My wife and I: 30s, married 2 years.
My wife frequently likes to have a cup of coffee in the evening &gt;2 hours before going to bed. I have observed that this makes her settle into bed more slowly. 

I have mentioned this to her many times. She has a chronic pain condition which is probably impacted by the caffeine intake, making it harder for her to do routine things, leaving me to pick up the slack. When I've mentioned it, she says her doctor does not believe caffeine intake affects her condition - that's not really my point, it's more about her overall health being impaired by less restful sleep.

This week I decided our household should be coffee-free, and discarded the coffee machine and pods. I told my wife that if she'd like to drink coffee, she should get one from the cafe on the way to work (this is not a financial hardship, and I rarely drink coffee in the home anyway).

My wife has been very mad at me for ""policing"" a habit she enjoys and considers harmless. I noticed she has gone to bed more smoothly since the coffee left the home, but as she continues to be angry and short with me, I'm beginning to wonder if I went overboard. AITA?",Asshole,1
"My twin sister Carly and her children have recently come down with the plague. In order that her negative partner can continue working and pay rent/bills, he is living in their home, and she is living with our biological parents, who both also have it.  I am adopted. She was not.

She's feeling down and really wants to Zoom with me, and the kids have been begging to see me. I want to see her, I hate that she's going through this, but after I blew up at her father \[my biological father\] at my other sister's wedding, I haven't had contact with our biological parents. \[I did apologise to my half-sister, and we're on good terms.\]

Having experienced this before where I went to talk to Carly and they inserted themselves into it, and I end up getting frustrated and trying to be civil to these people, and it just turns toxic.

So my (46m) fiance makes alot more than (27f) me like alot more than i could make in 10 years. He has two kids (17f) and (14m) him and his ex-wife (39f) co-parent and are very good friends. My fiance spoils his kids more specifically his daughter who i'll call kenzie...he gives her a ridiculous allowance and buys her anything she wants including a new car for her 15th birthday which he also paid for the customs, he also bought his son a motorbike.She's always buying new clothes she has packages everyday and food. My problem is kenzie doesn't work at all...yea shes a smart kid, her teachers love her and she plays sports and is always hanging out with her friends and is apart of a million extracurriluar ...If she has time for all that I think she has time for a part time job...I don't think she should be getting thousand dollar allowances and new cars and devices and if she wants those things she should have to pay for them herself...when i was her age i didn't have mommy and daddy's money i worked just like normal kids did...i think it's teaching her bad habits and entitlement and not preparing her for the real world!

I asked her why she doesn't get a job especially since she's going to university in nyc in the fall she said ""I just really don't want or need to i kinda just want to have fun"" fun is ok but i think she needs to be learn hardwork....I expressed this to my fiance and he was kinda annoyed and said (from text message) ""Everything she has she deserves same with ""son"" , It's my job to keep my kids happy,safe and successful and they are, she's a good kid and my angel and as long as she's being a good person and working towards something then idc she has the rest of her life to work and have responsiblities. Her only responsiblity now is to get good grades and take of her car....frankly i don't care to discuss any of this with you because it's none of your business they aren't your children""

The last part really upset me because I am about to be their stepmother I should be able to have a say and because I help pick them up from school and things only to be told it's not my business. I feel like this is going to be a problem in our relationship and I haven't changed my opinion..My sister and mom agrees with me but i've been avoiding my Fiance slightly because how offended i was...

"I (35F) have been worried about my health. I am decently overweight and have been successful in the past with losing weight but I am struggling getting momentum this time.

My partner (37M) is very supportive by making healthy meals that adhere to the diet I am following including tallying up the servings and nutrition facts in the recipes. He even does the diet with me sometimes even though he is in pretty good shape.

I fully understand that it’s not reasonable to ask him to keep the house devoid of tasty treats he likes. However the one thing I want him to keep out of the house is soda.

Soda my number one favorite ‘snack.’ I would choose it over literally any food. Soda also causes me to engorge on other foods rather than eat to satiate my body. I understand that all things in moderation is important but this is absolutely something I need to keep to just special occasions; not something I can have around the house.

He is absolutely unwilling to stop buying and drinking soda in front of me. He feels that he shouldn’t have to not have something that he likes because I am on a diet and won’t even only drink it in secret.

We have gotten into argument after argument. I feel that he should adhere to the one thing I am asking him to keep out of the house but he is willing to die on this hill. AITA?

"My (31M) gf (26F) moved in with me a few months ago. A bit of the initial romance illusion has shattered since now she just flat out tells me whenever she's sick and gives details (like if she threw up, has a heavy period, whatever) but I accept that this is life and that's just information you get if you share space with someone. I am adjusting to it. But she claims my ""need to see women as pretty things"" in her words is coloring my view of the situation that happened yesterday so it's relevant background. I think this is a hygeine issue.

She was driving me to work yesterday which is pretty close. Maybe 15 minutes drive from our apartment. Halfway there we were on a feeeway and she started saying she felt sick and wanted to pull over but there wasn't really a good place to do it so she just kept going and asked if she could use the bathroom at my work and I said sure, that wouldn't be a problem. When we got there she said nevermind she just needs to go home. She looked mad and when I asked she just kept saying she has to go home, so she did.

When I got home I asked how she was feeling and she said she was better. She also told me she had ""period poops"" earlier and had a minor accident in the car...... 

First I was just grossed out and told her she's a literal adult and shouldn't have ""accidents"" when she can hold it for a few minutes to find a bathroom. Which was a bit rude. I was just shocked because I know sometimes if you have the flu or something accidents can rarely happen but she isn't sick and periods are something she has all the time so you'd think she had a handle on them by now. But okay.

The real problem was her taking her jeans out of the washer. I asked if they were what she wore in the car and why didn't she just throw them away. She said it was fine because it was ""just a small dot"" and she washed them in the bathtub first before the washer. Which IMO is worse - basically she contaminated the bathtub and washing machine with body waste. I basically said please wash the inside of the machine and the bathtub with bleach because it grosses me out to think of using them now and she called me an AH and we had it out for a while. 

I was raised in a household where we definitely would just throw clothes out if they came in contact with pee, puke, or poop. Those are literal waste products and it's dirty to have particles of it around your living space. She thinks I'm being insensitive but I am respecting that she feels sick, it isn't about that, it's about spreading the dirt around the apartment.

He had some trouble with the Law before and it really ruined his life. I found out on accident that my younger brother's girlfriend was the one who told the government on him. Before that the government had no idea about my brother. She went to them not the other way around. My younger brother had just started dating her at the time.

Friday night before the wedding, my soon to be mother in law decided to get a group of my gal friends together for a night on the town and my mom was all for it until I  mentioned my stepmom Lisa (40) F, would be joining us. My mother has a one sided falling out with Lisa, and Lisa just ignores it, she's very respectful of my mom and has never given her a reason to be hateful, other than getting married to my dad. She told me if Lisa is joining us, she will not be. 

My parents have been divorced for 7 years, and I feel as if my mom still hasn't moved on. She's dated multiple men, and she's been with Eric (49) M, for 2 years and I've only met the guy 3 times and I honestly didn't really feel comfortable inviting the guy but, I didn't want my mom to feel like a third wheel going alone, so I reluctantly invited him.

Last night, I made it clear to my mom that both her and Lisa and my mother in law would be helping me get ready for my big day, being my dress takes multiple people to tie the back together. My mother threw an ABSOLUTE fit when I told her this, she told me she was ""my mother"", she gave birth to me and raised me my whole life, therefore she should be helping me get ready, not Lisa. 

I explained to her that it is my day, the most important day of my life and I would be super disappointed if she only made a short appearance to the ceremony, I also explained to her that Lisa is also an important person in my life and I want her involved. She made the excuse that she has anxiety and PTSD around my dad and Lisa, which neither of them have ever given her a reason to be. 

She also pissed me off by telling her whole family about the wedding even though it was supposed to be a secret, now grandma is upset that she wasn't invited. 

I asked my sister Hannah (23) F, for an opinion on the matter, and she told me to disinvite mom, because it's my big day and not hers, and all she'll do is make it about her and create drama the entire day, ruining the ceremony and everything, my fiancé agreed on this matter. 

I'm really on the edge of the matter, I want my parents to both be present on the most important day of my life, but I really don't want to deal with my mom's drama and have her pull crap with me, I want to have a good day and spend the time celebrating with my fiance.

"I (25F) have been living with my fiancé (26M) for 3.5 years. In our extended family, the custom is that everyone spends Christmas Eve with those they live with anyway. On Dec. 25th, we are at my parents' house with my extended family. They live 25 mins away by car. We always go to my family on the 25th because my elder siblings have developed this custom more than 10 years ago. My siblings are also going to their in-laws on the 26th. In my fiancé's family, there is no need to conform to anyone in this respect. He has a younger brother who lives with his parents and is single. His extended family consists of only his grandma. However, my fiancé's family lives 100 kilometres away, so we always go there for at least 2-3 days. My fiancé never has to work between the holidays. His parents has to, so as his brother. 

In July I got a new job and I got a total of 12 days off. I have to work between the two holidays. I have to pass 3 very important exams this fall, which would get me a higher salary and a higher position. When I told my fiancé that I wanted to dedicate all 12 days to the exams, he fully supported my decision. 

This means that we will either go to his parents for one day on Dec. 26th or that we will wait for the weekend and go there on Friday (the 29th) and leave in the morning on Sunday (the 31st) so that we can prepare for our New Year's Eve party.

When we told the two options to my FMIL, she was completely taken aback. Which I honestly don't understand, since from the 27th to the 29th she, her SO and my FBIL will also be working. She wants me to sacrifice 3 of the 12 days off (taking time away from studying) so that we can spend the whole day in their house alone and have dinner together with them in the evening. 

My FMIL and I don't like each other, she thinks I'm taking her little boy away from her, but I always talk to her with respect because I'm an adult and I understand that sometimes you have to get along with people you don't like.

 But then he showed me the groupchat and i saw who would go on this trip with him. Its a girl, a former friend of mine (we are still on good terms just not as close as we were when we were younger). Shes very pretty and she was good with him too a while ago and i think she thought that he would become her boyfriend and not mine ( she acted really weird after she found out, she asked me a lot of questions and wasn't happy but i didn't think she had like a crush on him). 
However she makes me a little bit insecure and i kinda don't want him to go on a trip with her. Usually i am not insecure even tho he is prettier than me but in comparison to that friend i feel insecure. Also his ex-girlfriend would be on the trip too. 
I didn't say anything yet because i don't know if i am overthinking this or if we would even still be together since it's in a few months and we are really young so it may not work out that long.

"My Muslim Eastern European parents, mother specifically, loses her shit when I talk about moving out. She says not until I get married.

"I, (17F) and my friends (All 17-18F) recently made plans to go the movies. We were going to see a by Disney (we are all movie/Disney fans). I was excited to see it, since I've never seen it before, only the trailer. Anyways, we were about to go, when my mom came back home with my little sister (14F) from one of her lessons.

As soon as she came in, she saw me and my friends were all packed up and asked where we were going, so I told her the truth. Big mistake. As soon as I did, she started being super hyperactive and jumping around and asking to go with us. I said, no, and that I was going with my friends, and we didn't have another ticket for her. She didn't like this and started demanding to go anyway. Now, a little backstory, my mom is a total pushover. She never stands up for herself, not even when people are yelling and pushing her, so naturally my little sister is a bit spoiled; she gets almost everything she wants, and when she doesn't get it, she gets something similar instead. I never got this privilege, since she only got a better job with more money once I turned eight or nine--she was too young to remember a life without it, while I was already accustomed to not getting everything.

My mom told me to let her come, but I refused and explained how then I'd have to leave one of my friends, which I wasn't going to do. I don't get to hang out with my friends a lot because they live in the next town over and I have school, and having a moment where all of us could get together like this was rare. Besides, my sister doesn't even like me or movies that much; she wouldn't enjoy it.

Now my sister got really mad. She stomped her feet and snapped at me, calling me a jerk and how I was always so mean to her (mind you, we don't talk that much besides when we have to, despite my attempts to kindle a relationship). I told her she wasn't coming, end of story, and she started to throw a full-on hissy fit. She screamed and stomped on my foot (which gave me a pretty nasty bruise) and called me a b-word. I-and I'm not proud of this-told her to fuck off, because she ""certainly wasn't coming now"".

I'll skip the rest of the drama, but she convinced my mom that I shouldn't be allowed to go because of my behavior, and my mom took away my ticket and told me that ""my behavior was inexcusable and nasty"". I snapped that I was nearly an adult, and this was the one time I'd get to do this with my friends for the next several months, but for once she actually stood firm and my friends all had to go home. My sister, nor my mom or I have apologized, and things have been very tense lately. I feel like an asshole and I'm thinking of apologizing for being a jerk to my sister, but I wanted to get someone else's opinion first. AITA?

EDIT: Thank you for the responses! After reading your suggestions, I've decided to add some more context to this:

\-My mother had me and my sister from an abusive, toxic relationship, and left a few months after my sister was born because my father (who I have never and will never talk too) broke my little sisters arm. She was fine, and when I asked her a few years back, she didn't even remember it, but that was the turning point. My mom ran away too another city and has lived in an apartment with me and her ever since. She is mostly okay now, but it made it hard for her too say no to anyone. I've tried getting her to see a therapist, but she has refused multiple times.

"I like watching anime, a lot of my friends watch it too and we regularly discuss it in our group.

  
I sometimes buy manga/Blu-ray and merchandise related to it. Anime merc can be really expensive so I have to save money and carefully choose what I buy. I even go out of my way to buy them in their original language just so I can directly support the author, even though I can't read japanese.

  
Now, coming to my tastes. I like Isekai/ fantasy, and generic ecchi/harem romcom. I know they are overproduced and people consider them to be bottle of the barrel trash, but I like them. Because they are so many I don't have the time to watch every anime. 

  
One of my friends, H, keeps pestering me about my taste. I mostly just ignore her. She had recently recommended me an anime which had just aired. It was on Netflix and I have an account. It wasn't something that I personally liked, and as I said before about not  having enough time to watch them all, I told her it wasn't on my watchlist and I probably won't be seeing it.

  
This got her angry and she insulted me and went on a rant. She said it was because of  people like me that the anime industry was failing, and that I couldn't bother to watch a good show even though I already have an accont, and I keep funding bad shows. 

  
I told her it was just my perference but she wasn't having it. She said that because of me good authors weren't getting any support, and that most authors had to resort to writing garbage to earn money. I don't think that is true, the authors that I read are really humble and enjoy what they write. 

  
She also accused me of sexism and that I should see it from a girl's POV, and that I should stop giving money to the bad elements of the industry. This felt like she was twisting the narrative to attack me. At this point I was exhausted so I just ignored her.

  
She later posted about it in our group and there was huge discussion about it. Some people were on my side, but she and others kept attacking me.

   
I know people say the same about Marvel, and while I personally don't enjoy MCU, I think everyone should be allowed to watch what they like.

"So I reported the store I work at, I'm not disclosing the name, to the fire department/fire marshal for the stuff piled up by our electric breaker. That is a HUGE fire hazard and there's highly flammable stuff there too.
But that isn't the issue. There is a person that is coming from another one helping us. I told her that I did, because I thought she would be on my side.
Apparently she's really offended that I reported a literal fire hazard. She's also lying about how she's been cleaning it. I had Covid all last week and it's in the same state that it was at least 2 weeks ago.
Then she's saying that i put her in jeopardy for becoming homeless? Also making it so she's using that to invalidate my financial issues. I can't get a credit card, I can't drive, I can't go to college, I can't get an apartment, l'm in debt on a DEBIT CARD, I have no money. My parents can't give me money because we need to pay for my mom's cancer bills, we're in a bad place right now too.
She's also saying I'm doing things that I'm not doing, like the stuff piled up. She also claims that l'm lazy, like I haven't been working 70 hours a week so I can get paid a good amount (we make $11 an hour, she makes way more as a manger).

down.

"Hi. I’m a 19M college student living with “Alex” a 20M fellow college student whose dating “Dana” a 19F also college student. Alex and I pay for the apartment, Dana does not. She spends a lot of her day here and spends a few nights a week. I don’t really care that much for her, I’m not crazy social so her being in the apt is mainly unnoticed by me since I spend most of the day at school, work, and practicing piano. That’s important, I promise. 

You see, I really enjoy the piano. I own a keyboard that isn’t great but it gets the job done and I’ve had it since I was 15. I paid for it with my own money and I am weirdly attached to it. I don’t like people to touch it or mess with it without my direct permission and supervision, and I treat it very gently since it’s a bit old. 

Well anyways one day I was in my room doing homework in bed as usual and Dana came in to talk with me about something. I was just chatting with her about nothing super relevant when she sat down at my piano bench. Okay, whatever, she’s not even facing the keyboard and clearly isn’t interested in messing with it at all. Or so I thought. 

We finish up talking and she stands up to leave, realizes she’s been sitting in front of the piano, turns around and turns it on. I started getting stressed a bit but oh well. She starts playing a few notes with one hand, and I notice that it’s come off it’s stand about halfway. Her fault? Maybe, maybe not. I stood up and said something like “hey, it’s about to fall, let me fix it.” Before I could finish my sentence, she slams down with her left hand and the whole thing comes off the stand and hits the wood floor corner-first. It clattered to the ground and I noticed a little white shard go flying across the floor. I told her to back up and walk away so I could pick up the keyboard and assess the damage. 

Upon looking at it, I realized that one of the keys had snapped off. I tried not to get angry and plugged it back into the wall, only to find that it just wouldn’t turn on. I sighed and told her just to leave and come back when Alex got home from work, since I just didn’t want her around after breaking something so important to me.  She said I was being silly and that she wouldn’t leave, just would go out to the living room. I responded that I’d prefer she just completely leave, but if she were to stay in the apt she should just leave me alone. She left my room and went to watch television in the living rooom. 

When Alex got back she told him everything, with an emphasis on how angry I had seemed while asking her to get out. Alex agreed with her that I was being irrational and a bit creepy over everything, and that it wasn’t my place to tell her to leave.

So, her two friends have been going in and out of our room frequently. At first, they would always knock before going in and say hi. But over time, I told them it's fine if they don't knock and they're welcome to go in anytime.

Two weeks ago though, this girl, Zee, moved in with them and I don't like her one bit. She didn't really do anything outrageously wrong but the way she feels entitled to just barge into the room when we're practically strangers and not even talk to me got on my nerves. Plus, she woke me up several times with how violently she opens the door.

So I told Lila that when I initially agreed to her friends coming in, I wasn't expecting such a big number and that the way the door is being opened would jolt me awake. She was good about it and said she'll ask them to knock from now on.

Zee only knocked for two days before she suddenly barged in again yesterday, searched around for what she needed, then walked out without so much as looking at me. So, I got up and locked the door. When zee came later, she was forced to knock and I only opened the door to a slit and told her I'm sorry Lila isn't in the room. 

She said she just wanted to grab something but I told her I'm sorry the only reason I've been letting them go in is because of Lila on the condition that they knock. But since she wouldn't she would have to go through Lila from now on.

She got mad and said she's not here to see my ""pretty"" face but because she was hungry and that the room is not just mine. I didn't want to debate this with her so I closed the door and locked it again.

When Lila came back I thought she'd be on my side but she actually told me I should have talked to her first and not do this directly to her friend. She said Zee wasn't required to greet me but that she'll talk to her again about the knocking. I told her she wasn't hearing me, that Zee is no longer welcome with or without knocking unless she's there. She said I was being unreasonable and we'll talk again. 

Well we haven't since then and none of her friends came by again. Am I the AH here?",Not the A-hole,0
"I’m 17 years old and in 2 weeks my family and I are going to Mexico as a family trip. I’m not a big fan of vacations and I’m the type of person who would rather stay home. I’ve been to Mexico a few years ago and it was fun but I honestly enjoy being at home more. I’ve told my parents that I would prefer to stay home, but they insist that I go. The trip is about 4 days, and I feel like I would be responsible enough to stay home all by myself for a few days. 

One of the main reasons I don’t want to go is because of school work, and I just really hate sleeping on planes and hotels. I’m very grateful that I have the opportunity to even go, but I would rather not. My parents are practically forcing me to go and I can’t help but feel upset. I know i’m entitled to not wanting to go but is it wrong for me to be upset? This is obviously a first world problem but I just wanted to rant. Sorry.",Not the A-hole,0
"Context: When I was 16, I got a 16-year-old girl pregnant. She told her parents, and her parents told my parents. Her parents were adamant on keeping her, while my parents told me that I would be responsible for whatever decision she decided to make. I didn't really want her to keep it at the time, and she didn't want to keep it either, but her mom and dad convinced her to keep it, so she kept it. About two days after she turned 18, she ran away without the baby and left a note saying this wasn't her choice. Our child ended up moving in with me. My dad had died a few months prior to that, and my mom was struggling, especially since I had siblings. My daughter's grandparents ended up being a really good support system for me and my daughter; they helped me out with rent, they encouraged me to go to trade school and helped finance it, and they are a very integral part of my daughter's life. She genuinely loves her grandparents; she begs me to let her go there on weekdays. My daughter is currently 9 years old.

My daughter's mother came back into our lives in February; she said she wanted to make amends. She had been seeing a therapist who told her she was probably suffering from postpartum depression at the time, and she ran because she felt like there was no other choice, which she felt awful for. I guess I could understand where she was coming from; we agreed that we would get our daughter every other weekend. Just until our daughter feels comfortable, we can revisit that agreement; we have it in writing.Now, where I am questioning myself is here. She recently came to me and informed me that she felt like her parents shouldn't be with our daughter after all they have put her through, and because of their religious beliefs, according to her, they are extremists, which is why they forced her to keep her.

I have never really witnessed anyone being extremist; they have taken my daughter to church at times, but they have never put any crazy ideas in her head. Me and my daughter are very close, and she still tells me when she wants to go to the bathroom (I really don't know why she announces it). And whenever she's upset, she always says she wants to see her grandma or pa because they spoil her. I came to the compromise that I can supervise my daughter's visit with her parents, but I can't just cut her off when she's such an important part of our daughter's life. She got upset and said that I treat her like she doesn’t have a say. I don't know whether I'm being an asshole; it just seems so drastic to cut her parents off from my daughter's life especially when i consider them to be family aswell.",Not the A-hole,0
"This probably will get buried but it's keeping me up right now so I thought I'd ask. 

My friend and I both work in the same nursing facility and have to assist certain surgeries. For these surgeries, we need to have our gowns autoclaved prior to the surgery day and it's up to us to get it done. 

The autoclave runs every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. My friend has always had high anxiety and always worries that their gown wasn't autoclaved on time. 

They have to assist a surgery Thursday and they turned in their gown to autoclave Monday evening. However, they forgot to pick up and check their gown today. They were a bit panicked and asked me to check to see if their gown was ready for them for the surgery and I said I would check before I head home. They even called me to make sure I check.

As you might guess, I forgot to check. I was already extremely tired and running on low so it entirely left my mind. When they texted me later to ask if I checked, I apologized and replied honestly that I forgot and that it's likely ok as they have always been good about it. Plus if it wasn't, she'd be screwed no matter what as there are no extras they could use but I didn't bring that up. 

They started swearing, calling me TA for forgetting to check when they even called me to remind me about it. I offered to go back to check since I'm not too far from work (maybe a 5 min drive or more) but they weren't having it. They even said that the saddest part of this whole thing was that they knew I'd forget which is what really got to me the most. I know I have a tendency to forget things sometimes but I didn't think it was that bad. It especially hurts because I want to be trustworthy but now I feel like I completely broke their trust. 

I'm very riddled with guilt about this. Everyone is saying I'm not TA but I feel like I really am and that I've broken my friends trust since this has never been said before. Which is why I turn to you Reddit. AITA for forgetting to check if my friends gown was autoclaved the night before their surgery?",Not the A-hole,0
"Hello everyone, I’d like to get an unbiased opinion on tonight’s events and if I need to give my boyfriend an apology. My bf(26) and I(25) were watching TV and unwinding for the evening. There’s been a sever thunderstorm warning here for 2 days so late this evening there was a lot of thunder and lighting. All the sudden my phone goes off with a emergency alert tornado warning. It the short paragraph it asks everyone to take shelter now and where to find it. Ok. Odd I was unaware we got tornados here. (I am new here) I Shared the news with him, and less then 5 minutes after my alert his phone goes off, same message tornado warning seek shelter. I am worried but he assured me this is not the weather for a tornado. He’s from Texas and told me about his how he enjoyed running around outside as a kid in the massive storms. He knew when he needed to come inside and right now there was no threat. Look, there’s no wind, just rain and lighting. About 7 minutes after this the areas air raid siren goes off outside. I said ok. I’m going to grab the pets and go downstairs to the basement. I grabbed their absolute necessaries and sat in the basement. I watched the news for alerts while the wind picked up and the rain poured. My bf went outside to see the weather, walked around the house, did his own thing. Ok. He did come up and down to the basement. About 30 minutes later I see the tornado warning is no longer on the weather apps. I decided to check the sump pump which we have been struggling with the night before about not working and while I was seeing if I had fixed it and watching it run he came down and asked if I had any plans of coming upstairs or if I wanted to freeze dry some food (sarcasm). I said no to the food and that I was checking the sump. I came up a few minutes later after getting the pets things. After checking the house and using the restroom he became upset I made him wait. Stating he wanted to have a nice evening with me but I was looking to dramatize the storm. He knows better. This isn’t tornado weather. I tried explain the apps, the alarm, the sirens. Nope. He’s from Texas. He is now upset that I ignored him. I understand wanting to have a nice evening but I would rather be safe then sorry.

"This is a throwaway. 

I am a college student and I live with a disability.  I plan strategically when I go out and what chores I do so that I will not end up paralysed on the floor from the pain. People with chronic pain and disabilities know what I am talking about.

Currently, I live in an apartment with about 8 other people so that we will all split the costs between each other. Before living together, the other 8 people already loosely have known each other with some of them being actual very good friends and me being the only new one to the group.

We have assigned tasks/chores to everyone and we all try to stick to it so that the apartment does not get messy. Recently, I had the one of the worst medical scares of my life. I had to go to the hospital and basically be there for a whole week while I didnt know if I was going to walk again. I have informed all my roommates about it and everyone wished me good luck. Everyone at this point was very nice and up until now I had a very good relationship with them.

That week my chore was to throw away the trash and I went in to the hospital on Monday at the beginning of the week. As I have been there the whole week I could have not possibly have thrown away the trash.

On Sunday, I get bombarded with nasty texts from half of my roommates saying how I dont do my part of the chores. How I am awful human and that I leech off them. That they have to do everything around the apartment. I said to them how could I even have done my chores? I was in the hospital? Unable to move? 

They said that I was using my disability as an excuse, a manipulation tactic to not do my chores. I had literally asked them how do they want me to throw away the trash if I cant even walk. Their response was along the lines of: you are lying.

I was livid. After that I had texted my other roommates and they all ignored me. When I was able to return back to the apartment, everyone the same day approached me in a sarcastic tone asking how could I miraculously walk again. If I was that bad as I have said why I am not in a wheelchair. Thou, yes in the end with medication and treatment I did not need a wheelchair, but for that week I was bed bound. I simply could not move. I have mentioned to them details that I would have liked to keep private just for them to believe me that I was not lying. However, it didnt matter how much I tried to explain I was labeled a manipulator.

I decided to block everyone and shut myself in my room. As for the chores, they stopped giving me any as I was called unreliable.

For 2 weeks after that I was called everything under the sun which was related to me being a manipulator. At this point, after so much relentless talking back and forth between them and me, I am tired and started to slowly agree with them. Maybe I should have thrown the trash away but I still cant figure out how I would have done that.",Not the A-hole,0
"My (32F) family (including my husband Mike 33M and our daughter Emily 8F) were at my sister's (Hannah 30F) house for dinner. We don't see each other too much because we live 2 hours apart by car.

Hannah lives with her wife (Tina 35F) and their son (Ben 5). I was helping Hannah and Tina set the table while the kids played with Mike. I noticed a few cookies on the counter and asked Hannah if I could have one before dinner. She said of course. 

It tasted literally horrible. It had a bad contour and honestly, I'd say it was barely edible. I told Hannah she really should get rid of those cookies because they taste horrible. She shushed me and said Tina baked them with Ben every Thursday and Friday, and that Tina took off time from her busy schedule (she's a lawyer) to cook or bake something together so there was no way she would throw them out.

During dinner, we talked about how excellent of a cook Hannah is (she is a SAHM and is a greak cook). And I joked, saying Tina should probably stick to her career in her law firm because she is not nearly as good of a cook as a lawyer. The moment I said that I felt Hannah giving me the 'Shut up' look and Mike pinching my arm.

I don't really see the big deal with a small comment like that. Even Tina herself was like yes no one can be as great as Hannah when it comes to cooking this and that and etc. This is where I may be TA because I took it a step further and told Tina maybe she could buy cookies like a normal person who lacks culinary skills.

I felt the mood shift a little bit, and it didn't get back to normal until we left. As we were leaving Hannah told me I was rude during dinner. Was I AH level rude?",Asshole,1

"I (F/24)  recently went to the Taylor Swift eras movie and tried my best to enjoy myself. My best friend (F/26) was telling me that she wanted to make friendship bracelets and I was like “okayy girl me too!!” And from then I was even more excited to trade some with her, some of the bracelets were a little personal and had really valuable charms attached to it. I wanted her to have a bracelet that said something that we both related to ( She struggles with anxiety, and I struggle with schizophrenia)
Anyway, we arranged to meet up at the theatre and I gave her the 6 bracelets that made for her and told her how personal the 4 out of the 6 bracelets were, but I wasn’t being vocal to her about NOT trading them in. She did give me a medium white shirt with albums that she wrote in marker that was 3 size smaller than I was, but did NOT give me ANY BRACELETS. She only made one for herself.

We went to buy snacks and within MINUTES, someone came up to her and asked if she wanted to trade bracelets, and my bestie said yes. I wasn’t upset because it was only one but eventually she ended up trading ALL of the bracelets that I made her, and gave the Taylor Swift clothing pins to random strangers.

"Hello Reddit community,

I'm a 28-year-old woman, and my first cousin, who is 24 women, and find ourselves in a bit of a complex situation with our family. Recently, we booked our wedding venue for the beginning of next year, a moment we've eagerly awaited. Our decision to tie the knot stems from practical considerations no romantic or sexual relationship with each other we will have other partners, this regarding primarily health insurance, as my cousin's company offers the best coverage compared to my own.

We embarked on this journey after I proposed a year ago, and we genuinely believed our family would eventually come around and accept our relationship. Unfortunately, our family remains deeply upset about our decision, deeming it wrong and labeling us as inconsiderate. It has been a challenging road, with mixed reactions and support from our relatives. 

Despite the obstacles, we're determined to celebrate as if it were any other wedding, cherishing these memories for our future family. Our goal is to provide a meaningful foundation when we eventually adopt children, so they can see healthy coparenting.

While we've received some support, it's been a mix of emotions, and we can't help but question if we might be in the wrong. We turn to this community for guidance, advice, and, most importantly, your perspectives on our situation. Are we the asshole?

"I (33F) & my bf (32M) went on a camping trip with R (33M) & V (M) in Medano Pass. We'd stay the night, head down to the Great Sand Dunes in the AM, & head home that evening. My bf & I had our truck & R brought V in R's truck.


Being a primitive road, it had areas that were trickier to navigate. I was trying to give R help in getting through the harder areas, as was V. R tells me, ""I don't want help. This is my property & I know how to handle it."" I could tell R was getting anxious about the situation, but as I felt his unease wasn't directed at me & thinking that even unsolicited help wouldn't do any harm, I continued to try to give him advice. R ultimately made his own decisions & eventually caught up to my bf. 


The campsite was across a stream, in a small thicket of trees; R pulled in closer to the trees. We set up, did our thing, & turned in for the night. I can't sleep when camping, so I maybe got 3 hours, which puts me on edge at times, but overall I'm in good spirits.


As we're leaving, my bf gets back across the stream. R, on the other hand, is planning the best route. I hear R say to my bf & V, ""I need help navigating the trees"" (to turn his truck around). I don't give this much thought at 1st, & when R is about to cross the stream, I again try to offer help. He says, ""I'm just going to do it this way,"" to which I simply say ok. R drives through the stream, but on the other side gets his rock runner & a small bit the frame caught on a mound of dirt. R gets out, angrily slams the door & goes to look. After he gets unstuck, he mumbles under his breath, ""She doesn't know what she's doing...""


Tired & unwilling to deal with what I perceive as misogyny, also become upset. We get through the pass & make it to the Dunes. I pull R aside & I ask, ""I understand that you're mad at me & only me. Is that true?"" R says yeah. I say, ""Well, you asked the men for help. Shouldn't you be mad at them too?"" R just stares at me. I also mention how all of those choices he made were his & that he acted like a child. R continues to just stand there. I acted out of pocket saying ""Are you going to keep throwing a fit like a bitch, or are you going to apologize like a decent person?"" R says that he will do none of those. In my anger, I flip him off, saying, ""Go home then if you're going to act like that."" He gets V & they leave.


The next day, I texted R saying I'd offer an opportunity to get a coffee with me so we can discuss what happened. His answer was, ""No. You called me a child and flipped me off."" I reiterated how that even though I was wrong to react the way I did & apologized, all the decisions he made were his decisions, that nobody forced him. I told him that in accepting help from only the men made him look chauvinistic. R replies that he asked me multiple times to let him make his own decisions, but instead I ""shouted"" at him (I didn't) until I got my way, & that he doesn't see the point of a friendship with some who won't respect him/his property.",Asshole,1
"Hi Reddit!

(english is not my native language :) sorry for the mistakes)

I (F30) had a pretty shitty year so far (my mum died due to cancer) and I’m now finishing my studies with a horror round of exams. It's 5 exams 6 hour each in 10 Days.

I have a very tightknit group of friends but since it is holiday season here, all of them are gone. I thought this wouldn’t be much of an issue because my boyfriend Max (M27) told me he would be there during my exams.

To clarify I don’t need somebody to hold my hand all the time, but what we agreed on was that he would help me with cooking (he is a great cook, it was his idea). I don’t expect elaborate meals. it is more about the gesture and not eating alone.

I told Max the dates of my exams in advance and I have told him that this is a stressful situation, but since it is only for 10 Days and he did offer to help me that I will take him up on it.

My first exam was yesterday. I texted Max last night to ask when he would come over. He told me he basically won't make it this week. He needs to sort out stuff with his flatmates, has band practices, is meeting with people and wants to participate in a workshop this all additionally to his fulltime job. There is a chance we can see each other on Saturday he just still needs to figure it out. He did offer to meet one evening I already told him (weeks ago) I can’t.

I then asked him if he is going to cook for me and he apologized but told me that he is just to busy. I was furious but since I can be impulsive I asked him to speak about it the next day. During the night he changed one of his plans and told me he could come over one of the nights that work for me. But it feelt like he offered it out of guilt. It was pretty obvious that I was upset about the whole ordeal. And I don’t want that. I’m rater alone than spent time with somebody who wants to be somewhere else.

I told him that this doesn’t sit right with me. That I want to talk to him about it, but after my exams. He didn’t understand and when I tried to explain it to him he blew up and told me all the days he “blocked” for me and that I’m asking for too much. But the kicker is that he listed way more days than before. He just changed the story.

I told him again I don’t want to see him for the next days and he asked me if it was final so he could make other plans than. I said yes and he accepted that.

This has been an issue in the past. I asked him to be there for me (the night of my mums funeral to be precise) and he was busy doing other stuff that turned out to be not important at all (his words not mine). We talked about it and he agreed it was an asshole move. So now I get the sinking feeling that If I need support and ask for it he is not going to be there.

I'm very sad. He says he is super disappointed we don't see each other this week. He feels like shit and he is angry about me canceling. 

AITA for telling him I don’t want to see him?

Am I asking for to much support?",Asshole,1
"My (54M) mother (77F) lives in a dementia care facility. She has been living there for a little over two years after being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s about 4 years ago. My brother Todd (51M) has always been mom’s favorite. He didn’t move out of her house until his early 30s because of his “mental health issues”. He was always a bit of party-goer and spent his early 20s getting high and relying on our parents to take care of him. Because of this, our mom has always been over-protective of him and has always catered to his every need. When our father passed away in 2014, our mom signed paperwork to make me her Power-of-Attorney when she were to need it because I have always been more responsible and mature than Todd and he could not be trusted with that responsibility. 

A little over a week ago, Todd visited our mom and a few days later I visited her. When I was at the facility, a nurse told me that my mom did not recognize Todd and was upset someone she did not know was in her room. I then told the facility’s administrator that she is to not have any visitors other than me. As her POA, I feel it is my responsibility to make sure she feels safe and happy where she lives. Since she does not recognize family a lot of the time and could get upset when someone she doesn’t recognize is in her room, I told the facility staff to not allow any visitors except for me and my wife. We are the ones who see her the most and are the ones that are most involved with her care. 

This is not something I wanted to do, but it’s what I felt I had to do to preserve my mom’s happiness as much as possible. Now my brother and his daughters (my nieces) have been calling and texting me constantly for the past week calling me an asshole for not allowing them to see their mom/grandma. I explained to them that this isn’t about them, it’s about my mom and what is best for her. But they are not understanding that and insist they should be able to visit her even if they do not recognize her. I offered to have them video call her (the facility has tablets they let residents use to video call family) but they said that’s not the same and are still calling me an asshole for not allowing them to visit. 

I think it is my job to do what’s best for my mom, and having visitors in her room that she does not recognize is clearly upsetting to her, but all of the backlash from my family has made me second guess. AITA?

Edit: since this has come up a lot, my brother and his family are welcome to visit my mom with me there. They do not like this solution because my brother works nights and it is hard for us to find times when we are all available. I offered to have set times a couple days a month that we all go visit together but they are against that and insist on being able to visit whenever.",Asshole,1

I ended up having a big attempt and when I contacted him explaining what happened he told he didn't want to be in contact and wanted me out of his life (didn't say anything about me surviving my attempt) we have talked very little since and that was 6 months ago, and things got a little better with conversation. But now i feel like he is avoiding me again. (No mention about mental health) I feel awful and like I'm the worst person on earth. I lost some I held very close and regret it every day.

"My boyfriend brought home dinner from Panda Express the other day and I took out my food and his food and put it on the tray, then I took out a soy sauce packet and put it in my rice and I tried to get as much out of it as I could because I was going to put it back in the bag because I didn't want to walk into the kitchen to put it in the trash right then. He reached into the bag to get sauce for himself and ended up getting soy sauce on his hand so he asked me if I put a used packet back in the bag and I said yeah, I thought that's where it went and he got bent out of shape about me saying that instead of apologizing.

" I (40M) work full-time while my wife (39F) is a SAHM for our two kids (3M 7F). Since she became a SAHM, her parents always give her some money as a present for Christmas. It’s about $1000, sometimes more depending on their financial situation. I receive a similar amount as a Christmas bonus at work though it varies too. We decided that our respective Christmas cash would be our independent spending money for the year that is kept separate from the rest of our finances which are shared.

This year, my in-laws are struggling a bit financially and as a result, gave my wife $100 for Christmas. I recently received a promotion and as a result, my bonus was $1300 this year. When I told my wife this, she said that we should split the money so that we both have $700 to spend. I refused because our agreement was that we would keep our Christmas money separate and spend it how we choose. There is usually a small difference ($100 or $200) between what her parents give her and what I receive as a bonus but we’ve never split the money 50/50 so there’s no reason to start now only when it benefits her. I also brought up how a few years back, my company had a particularly rough year and as a result, I only got a $100 bonus. That same year, my wife got $1000 from her parents and did not split it with me and I did not expect her to. So if she didn’t think we should split the money 50/50 back then when she had received more, she shouldn’t expect me to split it 50/50 now.

We have been arguing about this since Christmas as she brings it up constantly and it is causing a lot of tension in our household. AITA for not splitting my Christmas bonus with her?",Asshole,1
"I slept with my sister-in-law’s brother, Will, a few times before their wedding. It was stupid and we don’t even like each other but I ended up pregnant and I didn’t have it in me to get an abortion. I told my family first because I was worried this would ruin my brother’s engagement as my sister-in-law’s family are difficult and our family had already spent months jumping through hoops for them to accept my brother as their son-in-law. 

My brother asked me not to tell anybody until after his wedding which was 3 weeks away. I agreed to keep it a secret but it came out during his reception when my brother was drunk and confronted Will. 

Things have been pretty awful ever since. My sister-in-law is angry at me because she thinks I asked my brother to hide it from her even though he told her himself that it was his idea to keep it a secret until after the wedding. Her family are angry with me and want her to leave my brother as they think this entire thing was a charade for me to trap Will, and Will is angry because he thinks I should’ve told him first instead of hiding behind my family since I fucked him willingly so I should’ve been able to have a conversation with him as this was going to have a bigger impact on him than anybody else.

"I 17F have a grandmother that just recently passed away. My grandmother would frequently bounce back from our home country to the states where she would stay at our house for 3 months and go back because she had health problems that were best assessed in the states. Though she had 2 other grandchildren in the country who live not too far from us. Since my mom is the only living female in the family, she’s burdened with the task of taking care of 4 children (2 of whom are under 10 years old) and also my grandmother. 

It would have honestly be fine if my grandmother was capable of doing simple tasks on her own, but she could barely bathe herself without my moms help. Not to mention, she was very high maintenance because she had a lot of health complications. To make matters worse, my uncle has his entire single family home to himself since all his kids are over 20 years old. He had plenty of time AND money to take care of my grandmother. But because of ageist and misogynistic traditions, my mom, the woman with 4 mouths to feed was the one burdened with this task. 

Here's where I might be the AH. My grandmother died a few weeks ago and i was relieved. I could finally do the things that a normal 17 year old up coming senior could do instead of taking care of an old bitter hag. Every family member said a few things in her condolences during a funeral. When it was my turn I told my family members I had nothing good to say about her. Which was true. She never played ball with me, never baked cookies for me, never cooked for me, or even talked to me. The only time we ever interacted was when I would test her glucose levels, give her medication and insulin, and wipe her ass.

All hell broke loose when I said that, everyone started calling me ungrateful, saying that I wouldn’t be alive if it wasn’t for my grandmother. I was the talk of the family even days after her funeral. My mom stands by me but she things I shouldn’t have said anything instead of saying that I didn’t care about someone who I’ve known my entire life.  I know that I’m the jerk for saying that at a funeral of all places but I stand by what I said. Why am I supposed to care about a women who didn’t care about me? Am I the A-Hole????",Asshole,1
"I've been in and out of meetings this week for work, and one of my coworkers spoke to a woman yesterday who was looking for my daughter and I to invite my daughter (Hailey) to her daughter's (Jenna) birthday party. Hailey and Jenna are entering fifth grade this year at a very small school and have been friends at school since preschool. 

The coworker was pretty weirded out by the whole exchange and said that the woman (Erin) kept asking when I would be in, asking if I would have my daughter with me, asking my coworker if she could call me to see when I'd be back. She then told my coworker that she wanted to invite Hailey to her daughter's birthday party on Saturday at the local hotel. Coworker is assuming it is a pool party, but we're really not sure, as Erin didn't leave her name or contact info or even an invitation. She expressed to coworker that she wanted an immediate RSVP. 

I wasn't even sure it was Erin until through process of elimination I remembered that Jenna has a late summer birthday. Coworker gave her my contact info but I haven't heard from her yet. 

I'm concerned that Erin is going to corner us at back to school night and ask if Hailey can go to this pool/hotel party (which is this weekend, according to coworker), and I'll have to lie in front of Hailey and tell Erin we're busy. 

The reason I do not want to send Hailey to the party is because I have to work and won't be able to supervise. I'm not willing to send her alone because three years ago I hired Erin at a different job and she showed up to work in a caregiving capacity high on meth. I didn't even know what she was high on and just sent her home. It wasn't until a few days lasted she was charged with all the meth related charges and Jenna was taken away from her because they were living out of her car, and Erin was too high to get her to school. I haven't seen much of Erin at school to know what she's changed, but I feel that she really betrayed me once by shirking her responsibilities and I'd be an idiot to trust her again, and especially with my child at a pool or in a hotel.

"I get to the pharmacy at 2:55 pm and ask about medical certificates. I need one for a visa. They tell me that yes they do them, but not until 3. Perfect. I go to the nearby store for snacks and come back just as they open. I go to the front desk and ask about the certificates and they tell me that I have to go to the register at the back of the store to get charged for this. Cool. I go to that register, pay for my ticket, and get ready to head to another area where there's a doctor's office and waiting room. Before I can head off, though, a very angry woman approaches the register at the back. At this point, I should note this is happening in Mexico. Anyway, the woman clearly doesn't speak Spanish and in very angry English begins complaining to the woman at the register that she's been waiting for a doctor's appointment for twenty minutes (note at this point it's only 3:03, so the doctor appointments really have only been available for three minutes; I'm guessing they never communicated that to her though) and that they never told her which register to go to and just that she's generally frustrated. The woman at the register's face goes blank and she gives me a ""do you speak English?"" look so I stay to translate. Then the woman at the register answers (and I translate) that she's sorry for the mixup, that unfortunately me and this other man (who arrived at the same time as me) had beaten her to the appointments, but that she could charge her now and then she would be third. The woman repeats that she's just annoyed that she was never told to come to the back of the store, I translate, and then once the transaction commences, I am no longer needed so I head to the waiting room. The man ahead of me is already in the doctor's office. Eventually, the angry woman finishes her payment and joins me in the waiting room.

The man finally finishes his appointment after fifteen or so minutes and the doctor walks out and asks who's next. Now, according to my ticket, I am. So I say me and go to the appointment. Do I know the other woman might have been before me (when I went to the store to ask about opening times I didn't see her but that's irrelevant)? Yes. But I also know my appointment will be quick (less than ten minutes) whereas I have no clue how long she might be. And technically, on paper, I go first.

I finish my appointment, get the stupid certificate (this is my 4th try to get the right one; visa paperwork is a nightmare), and walk out triumphant. As I'm walking out, the woman turns to me and very snidely says ""You know I was here first."" She then walks to her appointment. I had already felt a lil iffy, but that made me feel really guilty? I didn't need to stay and help with the translation. I feel like I did her a favor already. I dunno.

"AITA (24F) for not wanting my Dad\`s (46) girlfriend (29) of 3 months to be at my Christmas dinner?

Bit of background: This is his 4th girlfriend since divorcing my mother 2 years ago and I have had to meet them all.

GF #1 (40) 2017 was invited on a month long European vacation after dating for 4 months. They broke up after because she was a pathological liar and opioid addict (his words)

GF #2 (37) 2018-2019 he asked to marry after 7 months together and he called their wedding off 2 weeks before in May because he didn\`t want to parent her 6 year old daughter. He blamed me at the time for calling off the wedding because I told him she is a golddigger (and boy was she) and said she just wanted his money (he took her on multiple vacations and bought her designers bags)

GF #3 (35) 2019 he invited to a concert after a month of knowing her and made me meet her even though I was still recovering from the previous one- this relationship started immediately after the broken off engagement.

Bring forward this one: he has known her 3 months and she is only 5 years older than me.

He sees her 7 days a week and stays at her place 6 nights a week (we live together) they never stop calling each other.

I wanted to meet her after Christmas but he said I had to meet her right away in November so I relented and had dinner with her. She is nice but very immature, definitely wants kids and marriage which is what he didn\`t want earlier in the year with his fiancee.

Fast forward to this month and we went on a 10 day vacation to Europe. We came home a week early (2 days in London and 2 days traveling) because he ""missed her"" He called with the confirmation number and changed the flight so we only had an hour to get to the airport. I paid for the flights but he had the confirmation email so he called and changed them while I was arguing with him. As soon as we got home, he went straight over to her place.

I am still pissed about my vacation being cut short and now he wants her to come over to our house for Christmas dinner.

He will be at her house on Christmas Eve and will be going to brunch with her and her parents on Christmas morning but I just want an afternoon with my dad and my family. Plus, if she comes, he will criticize anything I say to her and will berate me later on for it.

AITA for wanting half a day or do you think I am being selfish by not allowing his gf to come to Christmas dinner?",Not the A-hole,0
"So long story short I walk to work and every morning I see about 5-6 cops drive by no lights no sirens. Probably going around 30-40 mph. 
In a fucking 20. 
If I did this ( and I used to) 
They would give me a ticket. 
And they did. 
And honestly now it's my turn. 
I've messaged the police chief on Facebook to let him know about this bullshit. 
And I've also mentioned that if it keeps happening all call the local news stations who have radar guns and way better cameras than me. 
Then they can do a news special and setup there own radar trap. 
I'd probably be shot for holding up a radar gun. 
But the news station they can do whatever the fuck they want and get away with it. 
Much like the police themselves. 

I honestly don't even want to have to deal with this shit but how can I trust the very people paid to protect and serve for me of they are caught breaking the law at 3am when nobody else s around. 
If they are willing to speed how far does it go before they are making up evidence and illegally arresting people?
I might be the asshole but nobody is above the law. 
And I shall see that we bring these cops to justice. 
Wether or not I leak this story to the local news who knows. 
Hopefully the police chief investigates and finds these bad cops and gives them a little talk.

"My son is 16. He’s a smart kid, but he does some really stupid stuff. This was one of those times.

My son texted me that his friend was coming over after class. I wasn’t home but I don’t mind him having friends over, especially this one, who basically lives with us at this point. 

I get home after work, walk into my sons room, and see my son with a safety pin through his damn eyebrow. I freaked out thinking it was some freak accident, and they told me that no, they decided to pierce his eyebrow, and since they didn’t have a ring, they just left the safety pin in.

I can’t say I was angry, just dumbfounded at how stupid they were being. I pointed at my son and said “dumbass 1, we are getting that thing out of your eyebrow right now.” And I pointed at his friend and said “dumbass 2, get your ass home, you’re grounded from my house until the end of the weekend.” 

All in all, I’m still not mad about it, just mildly annoyed and still shocked that my 16 year old thinks it’s a good idea to let his friend come at his eye with a pin. I made him pay for the doctor visit, but other than that I didn’t punish him.

However, my sons friends father came over to my house unannounced today and started yelling at me for degrading his son by calling him a dumbass. I responded by telling him that his son earned the title by being a dumbass, and I shut the door in his face.

I told my son his friend can come over after he is no longer “grounded” from our house, but I don’t want his father around him or our family. AITA for calling a kid that isn’t mine a dumbass and for telling my son I don’t want him around his friends father?",Not the A-hole,0
"Recently I attended a concert in which my 'seats' were a general admission standing mezzanine/balcony. We waited in the line outside and then doors opened and everyone flooded in. When a friend and I got in, there was one solid wall of people already lined up along the edge of the balcony. We got in row 2 of the balcony in the 'windows' of two girls in the front row (aka we stood offset so that our heads were between their shoulders so we could still see the stage). The opening act came and played. It wasn't the best visuals, as my friend and I are both short, but the girls had a good enough amount of space between them making up our visual windows so I could at least see about half of the stage.

At the end of the opening act, about an hour and a half after doors and a half hour into the actual concert, two other girls showed up and said they were with the two girls in front of us. The girl in front of us turned around and said 'Sorry, can you let them through?'. I replied with 'No, I'm sorry, we've just been waiting here a really long time'. The girl in front of us replied with 'Yeah, that's why we've been saving them spots' and then turned sideways and yanked one of the girls ahead. Both girls ended up getting pulled in front of us so that our view was completely blocked. (My friend and I are 5ft and 5ft2in, so we had no chance of seeing if there wasn't space between the girls in front of us).

Two other concert attendees standing directly behind us (as there were about 4 standing rows on the balcony) sighed and walked away as they could no longer see, and eventually we walked away too. Our view for the rest of the concert was definitely worse than that we had at the start, which was upsetting as I cared about the main act and didn't care much about the opener.

All this being said, I started to think maybe I was the asshole for trying to not let them in front of us in the first place. 

I tried to put myself in their shoes and thought that they just wanted to be with their friends, and that the girls who arrived at the concert on time did try and leave space for them by leaving a bit of space between themselves. 

However, we weren't trying to push forward and take their space, we weren't trying to get the girls already in row 1 to move behind us, we just didn't want our view from where we were standing to be blocked more. I understand saving a spot for a friend if they're running 5 minutes late or had to make a quick trip to the bathroom, but to have two people show up 1.5 hours after doors, 30 minutes into the concert, it felt wrong to just let them go in front of us without at least putting up a bit of a fight.

I'm sure those girls are saying I'm the asshole for saying no when their friends just wanted to stand front row with them at the concert, and I want to know if I am. Am I the asshole for trying to not let them through? I go to a lot of concerts and if something like this ever happens again I want to know what the general consensus is.",Not the A-hole,0

I was gonna stick out the two weeks until an event popped up. Where I wanted to go on a school trip which would be beneficial for a college application! I thought they would be ok if I switched shifts with my friend (I'll call them B) I asked B if I could take his Sunday shift and I take his Wednesday shift. he agreed and said its no big deal he'll take it and I should just ask my manager. So I asked my Manger to where she told me ""No you can not switch."" I told her my reasoning on why I need Sunday off. I told her about how it'll be beneficial for my college, to where she responds. 

""No you can not switch, this job is very hard with our schedule we don't like switching and its irresponsible for you to ask instead of making the shift.""

"I'm 21, for context. My dad recently got out of a relationship (with the woman he dated after he divorced my mother) and it hit him hard. I supported him for several months and would call him every few days to talk. I was also having some tough stuff in my life at the time, but I didn't bring it up too much because he was really sad. He came on a trip to visit me and basically complained the whole time about the weather or his ex. I tried to change the subject sometimes to neutral things and he would circle back around to his ex.

We were eating breakfast and he was like, ""what makes my ex a narcissist?"" I told him that I felt that we had discussed the topic a lot and that it wasn't helping either of us to keep talking about it. He got upset but eventually came around.

I thought we were going to open with that but instead he immediately started talking about his ex and how she had texted him that morning.

After about five minutes of this, he was like, ""Oh, sorry, I was talking about my ex. I won't do that."" I just said, ""Ok."" He got mad at me and said that I should have said that it was ok and I didn't mind but the thing was that I did mind. I am so done with hearing about his ex.

"Never had a reddit about before but oh well.

I’m about to graduate with an English-Creative Writing undergrad degree. This is my last semester. My older brother is currently in a Masters-PHD program for  engineering. He recently finished his masters thesis and in his thanks/acknowledgements, he thanked me and said “he was happy to be my sister even if I was a terrible child”. My whole family thought it was sweet and funny. I didn’t.

I love my brother but he was very difficult to grow up with. My parents were very good about never comparing our differing spheres of intelligence but my brother was very adamant on me being “the dumb, evil sibling”. I wasn’t a great kid, I got upset and yelled and was an ass to my brother. But he was worse. He had anger issues that meant when he didn’t get his way he would react physically and constantly insult me. He’s gotten better but he’s very arrogant and self-centered, tells me I “ruined his childhood”, and thinks that my degree is stupid and worthless. 

I have a final portfolio that is my equivalent of an undergrad thesis. For me, it’s a big deal. I’m writing 50+ pages of poetry.

"I have been at my job for about 6 months now and have never been late or taken any sick days. Last week I started feeling lousy near the end of the day. About 10 minutes before the day was over I said to my boss “Hey I’m not feeling well and have like 30 minutes of overtime. Mind if I head out a bit early?”. Now just as a side note, if you have overtime leaving early is no problem, but still should ask. 

On my way home I was like “Alright need to get this hair cut out of the way and then I’ll just go home and go to bed early.”. After my hair cut I ate dinner and then started vomiting the rest of night. I tried to head into work the next day, but was still very sick and decided to use my first sick day in 6 months. 

I go back to work the next day and about lunchtime my boss says “I need to see you in my office”. She is upset and tells me she feels “very taken advantage of” because I had gotten a haircut after leaving early. I tried to explain to her that I meant no disrespect and that I really wasn’t feeling well. She said “well when I don’t feel well I don’t go get a haircut”. I then explained that I wasn’t performing at 100% and thought it would be best that I left rather then sit at my computer for the next 10 minutes working slower than normal. She wasn’t having it and started to get frustrated at my explanation. 

I decided to apologize again today and reassure her that I would never take advantage of her or lie to her. When I told her this she said “Well what am I supposed to think?” And stuff like “sick people don’t get haircuts” so she’s basically calling me a liar I feel like. She also said something like “quit making excuses and accept that you are wrong” which really irked me because I’m not wrong (or am I?). I was sick... Anyways she started talking about how HR takes this stuff very seriously and that I shouldn’t have said I wasn’t feeling well if I was able to go get a haircut. 

I was just casually telling her the truth and didn’t think it was going to be a big deal. I was well enough to get a haircut, but wanted to leave work a little early because I was feeling blah and wasn’t working at 100%. I honestly feel like what I did was MORE ethical than what she is asking because she’s basically saying that I should have just said “Hey I want to go home” when in reality I was just saying the truth “Hey I don’t feel well mind if I head out early?” 

I am extremely upset and offended over this because honesty and integrity are like core parts of who I am. If my boss can’t recognize those qualities after 6 months, I feel like I am wasting my time working for this company.

"My husband gets gift cards from work for hitting various targets, they're worth significant amount, anything from £20-£100. Unfortunately we never/rarely go to the places that take these gift cards and hubby just gives them to me. However my mum goes to these places fairly regularly, my mum has had no problem exchanging money for the cards as she would be using the money anyway and it stops them going to waste. Recently I had some extra and my sister said she would be going somewhere they could be used, I offered her the exchange just thinking it made practical sense. She got really huffy with me and said ""you get them for free so why should I have to pay?"" She thinks I am using her and my mum for financial gain,  that I'm selfish as me and hubby are better off than her and I should be giving the gift cards away for free because I don't use them anyway.

I just left it, but now I'm thinking about it and I wonder if she's right? Should I be gifting these?

EDIT: I don't want people thinking I'm some awful daughter/sister, I am a very generous gift giver for presents birthdays, Christmas and Easter. I always treat my mum to lunch when we go out and as for my sister I go over to cook her a dinner and help with the kids some days when she has to work late (while having a baby and hubby of my own to look after). I do try even though my judgement may not always be the best, I partially blame that on my Asperger Syndrome.

"Although I have been in their lives for a significant amount of time, my step-fathers parents have tried very little to make me feel welcome in their family. 

When I was a child it was less so, but when other 'blood' grandchildren were born, I was pushed aside. To be fair, my sibling (who is actually related to them) is also ignored. They care very little about the things that I do and if they actually ask questions it always ends up becoming all about them. They tell my step-father that they do, but they can't remember simple things, like what degree I am pursuing in university, or what grade my sibling is in. 

I still attend family events because my step-father tells me that if I don't there will be unneeded family drama. While this may be true, when I attend these things I am ignored. However, I am the one who is then in trouble because ""I make no effort to be more like the family"". I  really do try to interact with them, but they always start talking about people or things that I don't know or understand and quickly move on to someone who does. 

I also cannot stand the way the treat my sibling. They are cast aside for a different grandchild who is spoiled rotten, while my sibling sometimes doesn't even receive phone calls wishing them happy birthday. 

I also get in trouble for not visiting them during the school year because in their opinion ""\[City I attend school in\] is only an hour and a half away and I could be visiting them all of the time."" When I told them I only visit home once a month at most and it's much closer than they are they became very distant and didn't talk to me. I also get a lot of hate for visiting my maternal grandparents very frequently. My sibling and I have a very close relationship with them, which for some reason bothers the step-grandparents. They hate whenever we talk about them, and immediately change the subject. I understand jealousy to a point, but they refuse to see the fact that we live much closer to the maternal grandparents so it is much easier to visit.  

I am extremely tired of being treated like an outcast. However, although my step-father and I have issues, I don't want he and my sibling to become estranged from them because of me. As much as I dislike his parents, it should be his or my siblings choice to decide how much contact they want. I honestly believe that if I told the step-grandparents I had no interest in seeing them or talking to the there would be a humongous fight which would end up with no talking between families. I don't want to be the cause of a family fight, but I can literally no longer handle being ignored and not considered part of their family.

"i’m going to condense this as much as i can, and will answer any questions in the comments.

i (21F) live with my grandma (62F) while i go to school full-time to get my degree in musical theatre. i work, am currently closing a show next weekend, and watch her three animals while she takes frequent trips up north to see my greatgrandma (78F) outside of regular house things. to make a long story short, i grew up in a very toxic household with my mom and greatgrandma did a lot of raising me. bc of that we used to be close, but going to uni i realized she kinda treats me like shit and we often have fights when she comes to stay with grandma and i. which leads us into today.

i got home from my show and acting class practice today, and was just feeling very self-conscious about my acting. i am rather insecure, but don’t voice it to my family very often. they saw my show last night, so when i came home i figured i’d ask them for their opinions bc i was looking for a little reassurance to just feel good about myself. and her and grandma both instantly started belittling me for asking. they also hate that i’m not singing as much anymore and constantly bring it up (i’m currently in a shakespeare production, new passion) and so i said “i just don’t feel that good at acting” and greatgrandma said, “well, then just go back to music” to which my grandma started making jokes to. and it hurt my feelings. so i got up to go to my room and greatgrandma was like “would you stop pouting and just tell us what you want” and so i said “i just wanted some reassurance from you guys. you made the comment about music and it isn’t what i was looking for” and she was like “oh, of course it’s my fault” and i told her i never said that, i just wanted reassurance and she was like “what we don’t give that you already?” like... no this is definitely not it so i just went to my room and cried. later, greatgrandma said obviously loud enough for me to hear, “why am i trying to make her happy? i don’t have to” and so i came out and said “i didn’t ask for that, i just asked for reassurance” and then she just told me to stop crying and being sensitive and so i went back to my room and she followed me and told me that i was disrespectful and that she would never talk to her greatgrandma that way and that she would “cut me off” for talking to her like that.

i don’t know what they want from me. i got to school all on grants. i don’t ask her for money. i feel trapped but now they’re both pissed at me and i can’t help but feel upset. so AITA?

"For context, I live with a roommate. He’s chill. His gf is planning on staying with us for the majority of the month of January. I don’t mind, really. But they like to chill in the living room where my Xbox is. I have the newer games and such so I keep it out there, so that I can play FPS and when friends are over and stuff we can all play sports games. My roommate enjoys playing Fifa and has his own ultimate team and stuff on my account, again, which I don’t mind. But since his gf is here and they spend time watching stuff on the TV where my Xbox is, I want to move it back into my room so I can play in peace. He asked if I’m going to keep it there permanently and I said I’d probably keep it there for a bit, until gf is gone bc I don’t want to grind games for hours in the living room with a guest. He’s kinda upset, especially bc he loves his Fifa and won’t be able to play it for like a month. I told him he can spend time with his gf instead and I’ll move it back out later.

"So first off a bit of back story, my mother passed away when I was 16, and before then my father was a pretty functioning alcoholic, it was difficult but I could deal with it. After my mother passed he changed, he just drank and began to do drugs such as H and whatever he could get his hand on. I quickly moved in with my brother and completely shut my dad out.

As I was dealing with the death he was just absent and never even bothered to help me cope with the emotions, luckily I have a brilliant support network around me and I have been able to come to terms with the death itself. But as time went on he never messaged me, didn’t make an effort with me and again any funds he had (benefits) went on drugs and alcohol.

This was all in 2016/17 I should state.

Then eventually I find out he’s engaged, never really knew he had a girlfriend in the first place so obviously I am incredibly hurt and angry for moving in so quick from my mother I lose my patience and go a bit crazy at him, he just laughs and argues back.

From that point on I swore to never make an effort with him again, he was just ruining my life and I was bringing myself down because of it.

Go forward to 2019, and I lose my grandma very quickly and painfully, this was his mum. And I was pretty much forced to see him and spend time with him due to funeral and being at the deathbed. 

All my family get mad at me and think I should make an effort as they call his addiction an illness, I am constantly made to feel like I need to make sure he doesn’t kill him self with all the drugs and alcohol he is taking. But I don’t want to.

I have moved on from that part of my life, going to university and starting to get everything together.

"I got married a little while back, wedding went great etc etc. Now we're at the point where we're starting to send thank you cards. 

My wife thinks it's very important. I maintain that while it's traditional, modern people won't really care (or probably even notice) if we dont send them.


Points against me:

The wedding itself was fairly traditional 

Many guests gave nice gifts


Points in my favor:

We didn't send paper invites. It was done through email, Facebook etc, and getting everyone's addresses is a pretty big hassle. 

I've been to tons of weddings and dont recall ever seeing a post wedding thank you.

I really think people just don't care anymore.
 

Better for the environment I guess.


Too be clear I'm going to send them since its important to my wife. I'm just curious if people still consider it an asshole move to not send a thank you.


edit: 
People are asking why we didn't just send electronic thank-you's. I'm not actually sure. I guess it seemed like a half measure and if we were going through the trouble of thank yous we may as well actually send the traditional card. Would have saved me a lot of awkward conversations where I call someone to ask for their address, then explain that it's so I can send them a paper message saying ""thank you"" in a few days.",Asshole,1
"My wife and I just found out the gender of our baby - it’s a boy. We’re not first time parents, this is our third son. We’ve been trying for a girl, but my wife said that this is the last time she would go through pregnancy because she doesn’t want more than 3 children. The gender of the baby doesn’t matter so much to her as it does to me, so when we found out we were having another boy, she wasn’t disappointed like I was. She very much likes having boys and refers to herself as a “boy mom.” Still, although I love my boys with all my heart, and I’ll love this little guy on the way just as much, I’m still disappointed that I won’t be able to have a girl. I feel like I’m missing out on the experience of having a daughter. I always wanted to have a “daddy’s girl” that looks up to me and turns to me for comfort, protection, and advice. I can’t help but get the feeling that I’m missing out on something very special, something that a father can’t get with boys. 

Anyway, knowing that this was the last time my wife would get pregnant, I expressed my disappointment. I told her that I was really hoping for a girl and that although I wouldn’t love our son any less, I’m a little upset that I’ll never have the daddy daughter relationship I always wanted. She said that she doesn’t get to choose the gender of our baby, and that I should be over the moon regardless of our child’s gender. I can see where she’s coming from, but I just can’t share her enthusiasm right now. She’s currently upset at me because of it, but I don’t think it’s an issue that I’m disappointed. I think it’s natural to prefer one gender over the other, even if people don’t admit it.",Asshole,1
"Using a throwaway just in case. Sunday I had agreed to go to my MIL's mother's day dinner at her house with my husband. She and I don't get along at all. I think she's rude, I think she's overbearing and frankly I'm tired of gritting through my teeth to get along with her. But my husband loves her so I endure. 

Sunday he was out all day but we had agreed he'd be home at 6 and I would be ready to go. I had a very lazy day so when he got home at 6:05, I wasn't even out of bed yet. We were supposed to be there at 6:30 but since he kept bugging me to hurry up and I had to start from scratch, we didn't get to his mom's house until 7:30-7:45 and dinner was basically over. 

His mom asked to come talk with her privately. I knew what was up so I apologized in advance for us being late. She screamed ""No Bailey, YOU were late. YOU are late everywhere you go. YOU know I'm leaving for the summer and this was my last chance to be with all my kids and grandkid before I leave for the summer and YOU ruined it. YOU are so inconsiderate."" I didn't know what to say so I just turned around and left her to let off steam. We stayed for another two hours (until 9:45) and I just sat silently playing toon blast because honestly I didn't feel like interacting. On the way out his mom took another shot: ""well for someone who I feel is irredeemable, you didn't disappoint by being on your phone all night."" I told her I hoped she had a nice trip this summer which sort of flummoxed her into silence because she was so itching for a fight. 

The thing is, I know i'm late all the time. I truly can't help it. My friends and my family know it. They also get annoyed but they also can make light of it and just see it as quirky at this point. They also adjust by telling me parties and events start two hours prior to the real start time so I'm only an hour late. I've never been yelled at for it and I think she crossed a major line.

In it she talked about how I've been gaining a lot of weight over the last few months. She lists all the specific food she's seen me eat and says I'm ""constantly eating"". Then she complains I ""always complain that I've put on weight but keep eating junk food like no tomorrow"". I've mentioned it maybe TWICE the last couple months, in the context of trying on clothes. 

Then, she ends with writing how it's ""obvious"" why none of the dates I've been on have worked out, because I'm ""fat and socially awkward."" For what it's worth she also said she relates to socially awkward and doesn't mind it but that I'm ""clueless"" about how badly I come off to people??

She also called me dramatic, ""annoyingly obsessed"" with a guy who pretended to be friends with me (and her) and then ghosted me, said I don't have a life, and said she doesn't understand how I can be so ""full of myself"" when she'd be depressed if she was me.....

She's never said any of this to my face. She writes I complain a lot but she always acts like she's listening and tries to give advice? This now seems really two-faced to me.

So we arrive at Ben's apartment and naturally there is lots of alcohol everywhere and a half dozen other people there. Sarah and I stick pretty close together throughout the night, having drinks and just a general good time.

Cut to several hours later and the only people still at the party are me, Sarah and Ben. We are all pretty drunk, but Sarah seems totally wasted. Slurring her words, dancing up on me (in the past we have made out drunk a few times, but never anything more than that). I end up passing out for a while on a recliner in the living room.

When I wake up a bit later, Sarah is nowhere to be found. After checking the bathroom and kitchen areas, I go lightly knock on Ben's bedroom door. The door is slightly ajar and I can just barely make out my friend on top of Ben, with no shirt on. I ask what she's doing and she seems confused but insists she wants to stay. I'm pretty pissed off and still mostly drunk at this point, and decide to drive back home (about 20 miles and I drove both of us) and leave her there.

I make it home okay and am sleeping off my hangover the next morning when I get a sudden call from Sarah, panicking and asking WTF happened last night.

"So, my mom(52F) and I(21F) have been living alone ever since she got a divorce from my dad 7 years ago. She hasn’t been with anyone since then. About 2 months ago she introduced me to her new friend(47M) and the 3 of us went out for dinner. She told me that they were just friends and I didn’t think much of it. However, she told me a month ago that they’re actually dating and have been for almost a year now. But, the beginning was only a *digital* relationship and that they have been **meeting in person for only 7 months** now. I was surprised, but I understood that she had her reasons for keeping it a secret at first. So I reassured her that I wasn’t mad and told her that I was happy for her. I told her that I’d give her my full support and was happy that she was dating again after divorcing my dad. My father was her first boyfriend and love. She’s told me several times that she never got to date(my grandparents were strict) and she never got to enjoy the dating phase (she married my dad rather quickly and young). So, I’m happy that she’s been able to enjoy herself now and enjoy dating for what it is.

However, a few weeks ago, he proposed to my mom in front of me. She said yes. I was shocked and I didn't like that he proposed (kept it to myself at the moment and just congratulated them). They have only been seeing each other in person for **7 months** so I think it's all happening too quickly for them... I spoke to my mom a few days after he proposed and she said that ""if everything goes as planned, we'll be married in **March**."" I was shocked by this and I told her that she should wait. I told her to try to enjoy the dating phase and to learn more about him first (to make sure that they're ""compatible"" in every sense of the word). My mom got mad at me when I said this. She started to cry because she thinks I don't support her or want her to be happy. However, I've told her several times that I support the fact that she's **dating** someone and trying to start new again. I understand that she'll get married in the future, which I'm okay with, but I'm not okay with her getting married so soon.

"I'm actually half black, but unlike the rest of my family I'm pretty pale which has been a source of amusement since I was a child. No, my mother didn't cheat (she's the black half of the relationship), but most people usually assume I'm latino or from some foreign country, or that my brothers are from another father and my mother must be white. Like I said, I've always found it pretty funny and so has everyone else. My nickname growing up was white boy and I've always called my older brother darkie in response to that, and it's always been cool. I spend far more time with the black side of my family given my father isn't very close to his own, and consider myself black personally. 

Recently while out with workmates my brother gave me a call and we started up with our usual carry on. When a new (white) co-worker of mine heard me greet him by calling him darkie she looked noticeably shocked, and after the call ended she started to have a real go at me and told me that I had no right to speak that way. I told her that I consider myself black and she had the audacity to laugh at me and then tell me that I was white passing (I'm pale but I don't look white so I consider that pretty fucking silly to say) and then asked me if I was a quarter cherokee. At this point I got pretty annoyed and told her I could introduce her to my entire n\*\*\*\*r family if it'd calm her down.

She absolutely flipped out at this and actually stormed out of the place we were eating.

When I told my brother about what happened and what I said to her he found it absolutely hilarious. He's even volunteering to go into work with me to meet my boss and hang around the place so the new girl can get a eyeful.

I’ve changed and I’m not wired to see one woman for the rest of my life. She has told me that if I hide porn and lie, she will file for divorce. But it’s been close to a year and I know how to hide everything without her ever finding out.

We had a bad fight about a year ago and she stayed at her friends house that night so i was honest and told her I need porn like every other man!!!! We agreed that we would watch it together sometimes. She doesn’t watch enough, and when we do watch it’s only certain types that she’s okay with. I feel like I can’t even really enjoy it without making her feel shitty since I’m getting off on other women. So I started hiding it, she doesn’t get hurt and I get to see what I want to see. I need to see porn pretty much every chance I get whenever she’s not around. Like I would watch porn every single time we had sex if it were up to me, I like it more than most men. Plus she’s 7 months pregnant so her self esteem is shittier than usual and I’m not going to hurt her by saying yeah, I need to see other people’s naked bodies and make her feel like she’s not hot to.

Am I the asshole or am I good because I’m protecting her feelings? It seems unreasonable for her to expect me to not watch porn. All men watch porn or want to watch porn because that’s just how we’re wired. My father hid playboys from my mother for their entire marriage and they were always happy.",Asshole,1
"Am I the asshole for hiding the fact that me and my  3 other roommates allowed the landlord to put down rat poison in the walls and hid it from My vegan roommate. She found it and set it on the table and I freaked out and yelled “who the fuck put rat poison were we eat”. Forgetting the fact that we hid it from her. She’s freaking out so I’m wondering am I the asshole from hiding it from her? 

We have spent 100s of dollars on humane methods we finally gave in and agreed to have the landlord put the poison in the walls where they were getting in and to seal them. We had no idea that he put them out in our living space we would have never agreed to it. She’s freaking out because of the poison in general 

Also please don’t tell me to “move out” as thats not helpful to someone who has no family or support and is trying to get an education and work and needs an affordable place and it’s almost impossible to find a place this point in my city. Plus I love my roommate dearly I just couldn’t stand being sick all the time and weak with low energy. Do I not deserve a safe healthy living space or should I bend over backwards for a rat after trying everything in my power to keep in humane well getting sicker and sicker. She has a pet rat that she free roams sometimes and we never agreed to the landlord putting open poison In our living space just in the walls and for the walls to be sealed after. I fully respect her lifestyle choice 100% but the poison so far is actually working after already trying humane methods.  

Edit: We also had an exterminator in who agreed the best cost effective route would be poison and sealing the walls along with sticky traps (that we said no to) and continued to use the humane traps that essentially are just helping to feed them at this point.  

Edit: Forgot to mention one was in our cupboard and I grabbed a box of cereal and it bit me I washed the bite and kind of ignored it then I got really sick with pneumonia and a blood infection and was hospitalized for two weeks and my landlord graciously allowed me to be late on my rent. Not sure if this was caused by the rat bite or not but I suspect it didn’t help me any.  

TDLR: Tried every possible solution that we could afford to get rid of rat problem humanely. Roommate said absolutely no to any sort of poison but after exhausting other options and feeling ill health effects from the infestation we called the landlord and asked him to lay down poison in the walls and to seal them up after.  We went behind her back and put the poison in the walls and the landlord with out our permission left one out in the open in our living space. She found it and freaked out about it. ",Asshole,1
"Me and my girlfriend smoked weed and passed out on the couch early around 1am. My stepdad wakes up around 6am to go to work and the couch is the in the same room as the kitchen where stepdad needs to make his food and so he comes up to me and with the least amount of aggression that he could possibly use he pats me on the back and says you need to get her and get up out of here while were just laying there doing literally nothing at all to bother him. We are still half asleep laying there for about a minute where he then shouts LETS GO at us. So we got up and left sat in her car for a minute until he left for work and then we went back inside.

I've gotten frustrated with her and told her I wanted a divorce, going as far as sending her the docs via email and asking her to fill them in and return them to me. I never really mean it. But I have told her I want a divorce at least half a dozen times since May.

I'm just frustrated and venting each time. We are supposed to go to a wedding in Paris in April and I might of also told her a couple of time that I am not going for various reasons 

Just now we had a arguement I told her I am coming. But that I would just be attending the ceremony with her and spending time her rest of they time apart.

"To start this off I have a close friend group. It consists of my really good friends and my girlfriend. We get along pretty well a majority of the time. My best friend is a girl I met when I was younger. We've never had anything romantic, just a platonic friendship. During our friendship I started dating this girl, for privacy's sake we'll call her just GF. So GF and I had been going strong for a couple years before a sudden breakup. My friend seemed very happy about this and expressed that she quote 'Never liked GF much,'.

I rubbed this off since I was still a bit pissed off about the breakup and dismissed it. I moved on with that, not giving much attention to it. Well, GF and I ended up back together and we've been together for a year now. BFF decided to get petty with me and started making offhand comments about how we're doomed to fall apart and that some people just aren't compatible. I told her to leave my decisions to myself because it wasn't her business who I was or wasn't dating.

Skip ahead a couple months, I had a minor argument with GF. I had gone to BFF to talk out my problems and maybe get some advice on how to come at the situation. It wasn't anything huge, just a simple flare all relationships have. Upon telling her, BFF started responding with things like, 'You two argue almost every week. It's getting uncomfortable,' and urging me to break up with her. Now, we sometimes have joking arguments between us but we rarely have actual arguments. I stopped talking to BFF for a couple days aside from texting while I figured everything out. I ended up getting into a larger argument with BFF over the fact that I forgave my GF.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, GF was out with her family which isn't a rare occurrence. I was hanging out with BFF and just chilling out when I was suddenly in the conversation about religion. I jokingly mentioned how GF is Christian during passing conversation and BFF started poking fun at her. I joined in lightheartedly in the beginning, like remarking how it's odd she'd be with me because I'm the farthest from Christian in our group. BFF didn't stop after it started getting less fun and more actually insulting. She started making jokes that we're borderline offensive about GF and I was getting uncomfortable. My GF came home and I mentioned how BFF was talking about her religion. 

GF got a bit petty with her, and I accidentally started an argument between the two. BFF started calling GF slurs and other names so I stepped in and in a moment sort of decision I made a mean joke about something BFF is sensitive about and she got very heated despite doing the same to GF. BFF stormed out and left me an angry text at 1AM.

"8 years of my life, on and off, dedicated to a single person. a year or so ago, after a large argument, during a dark period, she started taking testosterone, i wasn’t privy to this. i slowly lost interest in her once we got back to talking... i finally told her about two months ago, that i don’t love her “like that” anymore. (she’s poly, so her take on love is different than mine.) she said she needed time to process what i said, and that it was massively impacting. i won’t lie, i was trying to get them to come to this realization on their own, and thought they did, but... that wasn’t the case.

This made me incredibly uncomfortable and I said that I wouldn't like to go any further with this man but that I'd be open to staying friends because we have a lot in common otherwise. He went nuts and was saying my view was unfair and that I shouldn't be judging him based on his past and I was close-minded and an entitled bitch for rejecting him.

A similar scenario happened more recently. Another match, he'd had a lot of hookups but had ""never kept count"".

"Funeral was for my mother-in-law’s mom who was like 95. I guess before she died she requested one of her best friends who is a pastor at a church to host her funeral. Her side of the family is extremely Christian and I am not but my husband is Christian just very lax. I would go to black churches sometimes growing up which could be you know, over the top, but I have never experienced something like this before. The pastor claims she requested he do his best to try to turn everybody at her funeral to Christianity. I am not exaggerating when I say we were literally screamed at angrily by this man for over an hour. 

At one point the Christians of the room had to raise their hands and he asked the non-Christians to raise their hands and told us we were going to hell. He told us none of us would ever see Susan because we were not Christian and how could we do that to her. I was so completely shocked sometimes and other times had my head down just about to burst into laughter. Nobody else in the room seemed to have this experience and just sat there with poker faces. I wish I could remember more but I couldn’t believe what he had made of her funeral and I truly hope that’s what she wanted, but my God. My husband seems to think I was kind of an asshole and should’ve kept it together more seeing as though it was a funeral.

"My parents divorced in 1992 and after that I saw or spoke to my father around five times a year until recently. They divorced because my father has always been after that million-dollar deal, investing in projects and ideas that go nowhere. He lied to my mom for years, telling her bills were being taken care of when instead he racked up significant debt in both of their names. He even emptied his own mother’s savings account, leaving her destitute. Flash forward to now and nothing has changed.

He is 72 years old and had a minor stroke in December. Being his next of kin I was notified and went to help out as much as I could. Once he was released from the hospital he told me that my help was no longer needed and that he’d be fine, refusing any assistance I was trying to arrange.

Since COVID I have sent him a series of emails with government programs he could apply to for assistance with living expenses. He never looked into a single one.

Two days ago I received a call from his roommate telling me that they were about to be evicted and she was leaving him. He hasn’t paid a single bill in two months and instead used her Social Security and his to send money to a series of internet and loan scams. The situation has become so serious that the Feds have frozen his bank account and are investigating a money laundering scheme that may have been occurring. To be clear, he’s not being investigated, but seen as a victim in the whole affair.

With only 9 days left in the month we are going to try to get him a stay under the new CDC order, but it’ll be a temporary stop gap and won’t work unless he applies for rental assistance. He could come and live with me, but I don’t trust him not to try and use my personal information or my husband’s to get rich quick. Also, years ago I promised my husband that he would never live with us, not thinking it would ever be this dire. 

Housing programs he would qualify for have wait lists. My family cannot afford to pay his living expenses and ours until he can get into public housing. His credit is shot, he has $1 to his name, owes people thousands of dollars, and lives over 2 hours away, not wanting to leave the town he’s in. I’m so conflicted. Do I continue to try and help him when he has refused my help for months? Do I take on the responsibility of being his conservator? I have a weird sense of obligation to him, even though we have never been close.

Update: Thank you everyone. I’ve made a report with Adult Protective Services and contacted the AG’s office about the internet scams. I called my father and told him what was up, reminded him to apply with the resources I sent, and that he’s now left to his own devices.

For all of those concerned about my husband’s well-being, nothing would have ever of been decided without his consent and agreement. He was actually the one suggesting I post so I could get some affirmation from people not so close to the situation.",Not the A-hole,0
"Ok, I know it sounds stupid for me to make the title like that, but hear me put. When I was in primary school, everything was nice (notice that I said “Was”), until I met some bullies who were treating me like a Jail Prisoner. Everyday in school I go into the classroom, and hear the usual “SURPRISE!” And see 3 bullies at the door. They call me stupid, a baby, a tomato (they called me that cause sometimes I couldn’t breath and needed my inhaler), they even stole my inhaler sometimes. Ofcourse, the right decision is to tell on them, but I remember that Snitches are bad people, so I didn’t want to be a snitch that time. They always push me to the wall or to the floor, they threw my backpack in the garbage bin and saying I was garbage. That all happened in Elementary school, in the Primary school I thought I didn’t have to deal with them (since we moved somewhere else), but boy was I wrong, I was in the worst class in the whole school, some of them failed the semester once or twice, and constantly were picking on me because I was small to them. One time they hit the top of my head so hard it began to bleed, I decided to wear a cap to hide it (some cool kids were wearing caps and I thought it won’t be suspicious if I wore one) and I’d wash the blood from my head. Luckily my parents didn’t notice anything. But when I got to high school, it got better. I didn’t get bullied, I made some pretty nice and awesome friends. But what was a bad thing was one of the bullies from Elementary school and primary school (turned out they were friends) both reached out to me through instagram and apologized for everything they did, and my parents saw the messages from my phone. The started asking me questions when I returned for the phone and I explained everything. They asked why I didn’t say anything and that it was stupid and irresponsible to keep something like that a secret. I just didn’t want anyone to worry...was I TA for keeping it a secret from everyone?",Not the A-hole,0
"I got about 1.5-2k in cash from my high school grad party. When I moved away for college, I left all this money in a bag in my dresser as I didn’t want to spend all of it when I was away for school (before you all roast me for not putting it in the bank, I know I fucked up). 

I went to school pretty far away (about an 8hr drive), so I wasn’t home at all for the first few months. A couple months in, I get a phone call from my mom, asking if I had anything of value or any drugs in my room. She says my brother (who is 15)  has been going in and out of my room constantly. I immediately brought up the grad money, tell her where I left it, etc. what the bag looks like. She calls me back later, says she searched the whole room and it was nowhere to be found. 

My brother is a little bit of a mess. Around the time this all went down, he was “addicted” to THC carts (essentially vaping marijuana for those of you not familiar) (also as of recently he’s in rehab for this). These carts go for about $40-50 a gram, and my brother was going through as much as one per week, with no job. No income. I came home for thanksgiving break and the first thing I do is search my entire room. No money. I was maybe too angry to be completely rational at the moment but the first thing I do is confront my brother about it. He said he didn’t take it. I ask where he gets the money to buy carts from he says he used money from my grandparents, who are very generous but nowhere near enough to feed this habit he had going. I ask why he’d been going in and out of my room and he says “looking for weed”. To this day I try to squeeze it out of him but he still says he never touched it.

The only other possibility is a cleaning crew who comes through our house occasionally, but honestly my brother taking it just makes more sense. My parents thought I was harsh to jump on my brother about it, and even though he won’t admit anything, they haven’t taken anything out of his savings or forced him to get a job to pay me back in any way.

"Hi, I’m (21) female and I have been having the same argument with my mother for the past year.

So, my mum keeps calling me lazy for refusing to help her clean up, but the thing is, is that I help her out a lot.

Previously I used to live by an organisation system, today we were arguing about how the kitchen isn’t clean but I clean it and this is how I organise kitchen; keep the sides clean and clear along with the floors. organise the fridge, keep it clean, use disinfectant and hot water to clean each section or the fridge and the freezer. Keep the fridge packed but not too packed, dairy and meat at the bottom but both are kept separate from each other, drinks on the side shelves and fruit/veggies on top. This worked for the freezer and the cupboards too. 

So my mother decided to leave all the meats in the fridge undone and leave them mixed in with everything else, like the dairy and fruits/veg, and the rotten meats that had been stuffed right at the back had made everything go bad. She then proceeded to stuff the fridge and fridge freezer with so much food, that it blocked the air vents and caused the refrigerator to stop working, she blamed me, but I told her that she was the one not throwing out rotting and out of date food, and for packing the fridge too tightly. the same happened with the cupboards, smelly mouldy food, causing the house to smell bad.

 I have always been the one who cleaned and organised everything, but I got tired of my 40 something year old mother acting like a stupid child who thinks I enjoy cleaning and reorganising her house because she can’t keep anything clean and tidy, so I just stopped. 

She yelled at me today for losing her keys and told me “ITS YOUR FAULT! THE HOUSE IS MESSY!” but the thing is, is I had JUST woken up, the house was somewhat clean when I had went to bed, so I came to the conclusion that her and her child had made the mess. 

She then proceeded in digging into me calling me a selfish bitch and telling me I have always been lazy, useless and all the mess is mine, so.. I lost. “ You and YOUR son make the mess in this house, You, mum, ignore that fact that I organise so much for you and you mess it all up by throwing everything around and over packing everything, you let your son make messes and expect me to teach him to clean up or to just clean up for him, so fuck off and take responsibility for your crap and I’ll do the same with mine, and don’t ever call me lazy when you just sit in your bedroom, doing nothing but getting into racist/Karen like comment wars on tiktok”

So Reddit, am I the butthole for blowing up at my mother for her constant jabbing at me? How should I cope with this? I cry on a day to day basis because of this crazy lady.

"So the title is basically self-explanatory. It's my birthday tomorrow, and I'm not really planning on doing anything special to celebrate.

Anyway, I've been getting messages from a few of my friends about what I want to do to celebrate, and I've basically told them all that I don't want to do anything.

I wasn't planning on doing anything special though"". He and another friend both kind of replied by sarcastically pointing out how not excited I was and that they just wanted to talk me to lunch.

I appreciate the thought. But I genuinely just want to have a normal day, and don't appreciate getting attitude from other people for not wanting to celebrate.

Ive had a lot of health issues in my late teens and twenties (30s now and still ongoing, I can't work) that has prevented me from really achieving anything. I've had countless surgeries and at times have been almost bedridden for year or more at a time. This in turn had really affected my mental wellbeing. I genuinely feel like a worthless loser.

My siblings are very well off, too. Went to fancy schools and have fancy careers just like my parents. My parents paid for their weddings even though they didn't need to. Naturally, I thought my parents would pay for mine too. But once I started planning with my mom and sisters, I started getting shrewd comments about how I'm going to afford things like a dress, flowers, etc. I asked my parents if they were paying and they made it very clear that, no, they were not because I had not earned it. I've not achieved anything in life and don't deserve extravagant gifts like that. It really hurt.

In middle and high school she punished me for bad grades or forgotten assignments, despite me being a good student otherwise and it was all the undiagnosed ADHD. I was sheltered a lot and even still today she needs to know where I am at all times. If I don’t text her when I leave to go someplace, she might call me and ask why the hell I didn’t text her and call me irresponsible. 
It’s stressful and I haven’t really built the case for why I might be the asshole, but I honestly feel like it would be too much for her to be an empty nester. Like I said she has anxiety and a lot of pain problems, and managing the house would be a lot. I do help her where I can, we are not always in a rocky place but it spikes here and there. I’m 19 almost 20 and in a serious relationship, and I feel like an asshole for prioritizing my boyfriend (who I do love very much) over my mother. Especially since I’m with him most nights out of the week and come home at 10pm when she’s asleep, so I hardly see her. It’ll be probably a year or so before we move in together, but I still feel bad. AITA??",Not the A-hole,0
"My now-ex and I had been together in a long-distance, transatlantic relationship for almost 4 years. We had just been on a six-month ""break"" because he feels like this distance has made him very lonely. There's no way we can be together physically right now or any time soon. He wants someone who he can physically be with for more than a few weeks at a time. We officially called it off yesterday. I am absolutely devastated by this breakup. I am absolutely still in love with him, even after this ridiculously long, fruitless break.

Essentially, the break happened because I said I didn't feel like I could be just friends with him. He was everything I wanted in a partner, and I didn't feel like I could handle watching him be that exclusively for someone else. I've felt this way with partners in the past, too. He didn't want me not in his life, though.  He really wanted to be my friend still. The break was supposed to be more like a compromise; we would cut the romance down and still talk to each other. He would try to date locals. We would both work on our mental health. He kind of just avoided me a lot, which hurt. All of our conversations were superficial and short. He said he avoided me because he didn't want to conflate platonic relations with romantic ones. A couple of weeks ago, he had his first date with someone else; now he wants to try to make things work with her. He still insists that he will be a good friend to be and be there for me. The thing is, though, I don't know if I want him to be. I just don't think I can handle the facade of platonic feelings when I am still very, very in love with him. I don't know when or if I will fall out of love with him. I also don't know why I am obligated to stay his friend when he broke my heart. Honestly, in my head, the only benefit of staying friends is that we could potentially get back together again. However, I don't know if that's even possible, and I don't know if I can handle staying friends with him for something that might not happen. Am I the asshole?

Edit: I forgot to add this. I think he genuinely wants to stay friends with me because he told me that's why he needed the break to end. He wanted to be able to be my friend without romantic undertones. He seems really saddened by the idea of us not being friends. I also have a hard time trusting him to actually be a good friend to me because of how he treated me on that break though.

"Recently my friend (F17) came back from a three year posting to France. Before her posting we were quite close however on the couple of occasions she visited my home town during her three years away, I found that she had changed quite a bit into someone I didn’t want to be around. While she was always nice to me, she was often rude to strangers, said nasty things to her parents and had a habit of shop lifting-  all of which made me very uncomfortable.

Now that she is back home permanently, her mother proposed to my mother that I go 2 or 3 times a week to the gym with her, as she is struggling to fit back in here amongst her friends and has lost a lot of her confidence. I refused as, although I do feel sorry for her situation, I feel that as a 16 year old I should be able to choose my friends based off of their morals, values and character.

Am I the asshole for refusing to go to the gym a few times a week with a friend I no longer like?",Not the A-hole,0
"Ever since I was a little girl I've always liked holding hands with my dad when we walked somewhere together. I never really went through that particular ""teenager embarrassed by showing affection to my parents"" thing that a lot of teenagers go through. 

The only real effect that growing up has had is that it's actually more comfortable to hold hands since we're of similar heights now.

My mum really hates it when we hold hands in public, she freaks out about people getting the wrong idea, that we're going to get arrested? Seriously, all we are doing is being two adults holding hands. My dad gets really annoyed at her when she starts up.

We don't really care what assumptions a bunch of strangers may or may not have. I doubt most people would even spare any energy to care about two people holding hands. I accept that maybe it's a little weird, and most people wouldn't but it's something we've always done to be affectionate.

"There was this streamer I used to watch and I was subbed to him for four and a half years.  Recently, I had cut all ties with him because of this one event that happened between us.  About two weeks ago, he did a livestream on a game and allowed other people to join in so I decided to join in as well.  Most of the people playing with him were in a voice chat on his discord server: I was also in the voice chat.  Things were going good at first but then this happened.  During the stream, I said in the voice chat “This stream has been sponsored by Raid Shadow Legends.” as a joke.  Apparently, he didn’t like it and decided to mute me for the rest of the stream.  Later on during the stream, I told him on his livestream chat that the mute was unnecessary and that I was only making a joke.  He responded by saying that it was necessary and that saying stuff like on his stream that could get him sued by Raid Shadow Legends.  I thought he was just overreacting because I seriously doubt that would actually happen since Raid Shadow Legends would’ve been able to easily tell that it was just a joke.  If what he was saying was completely reasonable though, I would’ve felt sorry since I never had any intentions of possibly getting him in serious trouble.  I was thinking that it would’ve been okay since the whole Raid Shadow Legends sponsorship thing was basically a meme.  I still haven’t been in touch with him since and I don’t ever plan on getting in touch with him again.",Not the A-hole,0
"Okay so I (13F) and my friends (14F) (13F) (13F) decided on Valentines day to give Valentines to our own friends in other classes, whether it would be awkward or not. At first I didn't want to join but they peer pressured me to play along. The twist is they have to choose which friend I have to send a letter to and they write it. So of course they chose this girl I will name Gemma for the sake of this. Gemma and I use to be good friends in elementary I guess, but we fell out. She probably thinks I hate her and she and I have a very awkward relationship. The letter contained on how sorry I am for being kind of mean to her even if I was not and I was just shy and trying to actively avoid her. I didn't want them to think I was lame to not play along, so I only agreed if one of my friends who I'll call Liza will personally give the letter and NOT tell that I was the one who gave it, she agreed. By the time we where giving out letters Liza told me to already give my letter so if she sees Gemma she will give it. I said sure. Now here's when the problem starts, Liza saw one of Gemma's classmates so she quickly handed over the letter. There wouldn't be a problem if she didn't say IT WAS WRITTEN AND GIVEN PRESONALLY BY ME (even if I didn't write it). So out of panic I quickly snatched the letter, crumpled it up, and threw it out the balcony(?) (We where on the second floor). Liza raced down outside to retrieve it. I thought it was done until I went down and saw Liza she told me that she saw the classmate again and gave him the letter again and told it was by me. So I was upset and quickly went home without them (We gave out the letters after school). They haven't texted me or anything about the situation and I'm scared that they would avoid me on Monday since they always do that when they're mad. I feel really guilty for not going along with them since they all gave out their letters to their friends without a problem and I had to make such a scene. So AITA?",Not the A-hole,0
"So my previous roomate (We’ll call her G) was one I would define as manipulative. Here’s a few things she’s done to me and my other roomate (we’ll call her P). 
- -overcharging $100 for rent becuase she “forgot the number” and it was the number she remembered off the top of her head 
- Charging P 75% of power without telling her becuase she “left her lamp on too much”, meanwhile G leaves her lights and TV on for her dog when she leaves so her dog “doesn’t get bored”
- Adopting a cat and telling us we were getting a cat instead of asking (which we didn’t mind honestly, we liked the idea, but she told instead of asked) and said she was taking care of it and getting it neutered within the week of getting it... 4 months later, no neuter and message in the group chat saying she can’t afford the cat so we would have to start paying or he was going to the shelter
- Borrowing things without asking and having to find them ourselves
- Blaming everything on us: when the ac broke, walking up to P and saying “what did you do” in an accusatory tone
- Talking humorously about making herself have an eating disorder on multiple occasions when she knows we were both recovering from one together and it’s triggering to hear
- Never contacting charter and lying about having someone to install WiFi for 2 weeks (saying “oh yeah, I called and they’re sending someone this Thursday) and P calls and finds out that she never called and has $300 of delinquent fees 
- Talking shit about me to P and then claiming she can’t trust anyone in the house when confronted and asked to speak her mind to me instead of gossiping to P who I’ve known for 10 years 
- Leading people on and ghosting them against my advice and getting mad at me and doing passive aggressive things when I wasn’t happy with her for it 
- Getting mad at me for hosting an event of 10 ppl when I gave 4 days notice and then had 6 people sleeping in the living room for 4 days with no notice. 
- letting her friends use my bathroom at 4 in the morning to puke, use my hand towel to wipe their vomit, and leaving it on the back of the toilet to dry (she never cleaned it up)
- asking my boyfriend to pay rent since he stayed the night a few times a week

Long story short, me and P decided it was best for our mental health and comfort to move away from G. We knew by telling her, she would start doing passive aggressive things to us. We told her 2 weeks before we decided to move out and knowing her dad was the landlord, she would be okay. She started gaslighting us so we left while she was out of town, before the next months rent was due. It was at the end of the 2 week period. AITA?",Not the A-hole,0

"Back in mid-August, my book club picked out a new book and set our discussion date for the end of September. That gave me a nice window of time to get into this book. Or so I thought.

Since I had some time, I decided to order the book used from a third-party seller on Amazon. The advertised ETA was between September 2 and September 10. 

Shortly after ordering, on August 20, I got a notification that the book had already shipped! There was a USPS tracking number and everything. Great! 

I didn't check in on the status of the shipment until after Labor Day, when I tracked the package... USPS said ""label created but package not yet in system."" I'm pretty sure that means that the seller printed the label using an at-home printer, but they hadn't dropped it off at the post office yet. 

Ok, I thought, well they could still ship it tomorrow and have it arrive on time, so I didn't bother checking with them yet.

On September 10, however, I got a notification from Amazon that the package might not arrive until 9/16, and that if I didn't get it by then I could ask for a refund. When I got that I sent a message to the seller asking if they had sent the book yet. I got no response. 

On 9/16 (yesterday) I still hadn't gotten it. So I wrote another message to the seller asking what was up. Finally this morning they responded as follows:

&gt;Thank you for writing. In following up to make sure your order was delivered to you, I am not getting a response to my tracer and it has not come back to me so I had to assume it is lost in the Postal System. I sent out a new copy on September 16th, you should have it in a few days.

Sure enough, the tracking # now shows the package starting its journey late last night. I have no idea how long it will take to get to me—USPS is not giving me an ETA—but given the location and the fact that it looks like it's traveling pretty slow thus far, I think it will take a week, leaving me less than a week to read it before the book club meeting.

I'm pretty sure the seller lied about the book getting ""lost in the Postal System"" because the tracking number for the ""new"" package is the very same tracking number as the package that was ""sent"" on 8/20. Now I'm not an expert but I'm pretty sure if a package gets lost in the mail I can't just recycle the same tracking number as the one that got lost.

So here's where I need Reddit's help. I don't really need the money back, and I'm not *that* excited about reading this book anyway, so if I don't get through it it's fine and I have a good excuse! But I'm pissed off that the seller is throwing USPS under the bus for something that's clearly the seller's fault. That's the main reason I want to demand a refund... I want to punish these people, which would have the fun side-effect of getting a free book.

So, would it be petty, and therefore assholish, to demand my money back (it's like $15) even though it appears I will eventually get this book and that even though the delay is mildly annoying, I'll survive?",Asshole,1
"Well I hope someone gets a laugh out of this and can tell me if IATA because we're in the middle of a big argument.

My (35f) and my husband (38m) were messaging today about nothing much when he sent his scowling Memoji and i sent one back. He said ""is that your determined sex face, because i like it."" Out of the blue. Like, we were talking about the weather and it was 10am and he was at work. I was like ""what? what is that"" and he said ""i'll tell you next time you do it.""

I said that was mean and i felt humiliated, and we got into this massive argument after he rang an hour later and I started crying about it.  I feel so mortified and am not sure how I'm going to be intimate with him again knowing he's on the lookout for my 'determined sex face' and will point it out to me next time, FFS. He said he was trying to flirt??

My husband thinks i'm being oversensitive of course. i think it's perfectly rational to get upset about being mocked for appearance or activities otherwise during sex. We all know we look stupid having sex but you kind of trust your partner not to mock you for it or draw attention to how your body looks or the embarrassing stuff you do and say during sex.

I mean is it ever ok to joke about the other partner's sex face? I feel like that is a massive taboo and am feeling really betrayed, hurt, and even more so because he doesn't get it and says I'm overreacting.

AITA for being upset about this comment he thinks is fine?

EDIT: OK, OK thank you internet strangers, i see by the overwhelming majority already that I have overreacted to this. i still think it's not something you joke about or even make reference to and tbh I will never forget this and will remember it and feel embarrassed every time we have sex again but apparently i've missed the humanity-wide memo it's ok.

"Clarification - so it seems people missed the part where I say that I do help her with things. I just built a large piece of furniture with her last weekend on my only day off. And I went to Home Depot with her to pick up materials to fix our fence. Look, I'm just asking that she try to give me alone time when I get home from work and that unless something urgent needs to be taken care of that she really can't do herself, if she can hold off the requests until my day off.

Me \[32M\] and my girlfriend \[28F\] have been together for 4 years and are both residents, her in psychiatry where she's working from home now and I'm in medicine. We also just recently moved houses so there's the added stress of that. We have recently been arguing a lot as I'm tired from working 12+ hr days and coming home to conversation about unimportant stuff like what interesting patient she had or what decoration we should get for the table. On top of that, she'll ask me to help take the trash out or load the dishwasher, tasks I would normally be OK doing but I'm just so tired nowadays.

What she's claiming is that I can't be THAT tired to carry on simple conversation or help out with small tasks. She claims to do everything around the house like cooking, laundry, cleaning but that's not entirely true because I help her build furniture, move heavy things around, etc. She says she wants me to contribute more and not just, quoting her words, ""come home and eat and plop my ass down on the sofa and go to sleep"".

From my perspective, I really am just THAT tired. I work 6 days a week and then on my one day off, I have to help her do stuff like build furniture, fix the fence, and other things that she can't do by herself. And on top of that, she complains that we don't spend quality time together so I have to go for walks with her and go out to eat when all I really want to do is fall asleep in front of the TV.

So in order to stave off more arguments and whining from her, I suggested we make a rule that beyond a few minutes of conversation over dinner, she is not allowed to carry out long protracted conversations with me about non-urgent stuff and she is not allowed to ask me to do anything non-urgent as well, like take out the trash or do the dishes. She is basically sitting at home doing minimal work from 9-5pm some days and even has some half days off due to decreased patient volume so I don't feel bad that she has to do most of the housework.

"Some backstory

Due to the pandemic, I'm work from home since March.  Not a big deal.  My dog loves me being home and spending more time with me.  We live, just her and me.  Unfortunately, shortly after at a vet checkup, she was diagnosed with lung cancer and I had to make the hardest decision of my life in late July to have her put to rest.  I was devastated.

As if it wasn't hard enough losing her, it became very lonely in my apartment so I wanted to get another dog.  I headed to the local shelter to see what animals are up for adoption and there were several I was interested in so I filled out an application.  One of the things in the application was that if you live in an apartment, you need landlords consent.  This shouldn't be a problem, I paid a one time pet deposit 10 years ago for my little girl so I called the landlord to get approval.  Well, they decided they are thinking of changing the policy and will get back to me by the end of the week.  End of the week comes and no word, so I call them and they tell me maybe by the end of the month but end of the year at the latest.  I argued with them that they already confirmed that I paid the deposit so what was the issue, but they refused to give consent even though legally I can have a dog.

So I bypassed the system.  I brought my mom with me to the shelter, she lives in a house so doesn't need landlord consent and we found a great guy, a wonderful 4 year old Beagle mix who stole my heart, then he came home with me even though technically she adopted him.  He's been spoiled rotten ever since and loves his new home.

The landlord has no recourse and since then my lease has expired and I'm moving out next week.  So reddit, AITA for getting a new buddy even though the landlord wouldn't sign off on it?

Yes, I know I have to pay the dog tax, this is [Maggie](https://imgur.com/4qNHdY5), who I lost in July.  And this is [Vinnie](https://imgur.com/0GmLXGy), getting his favorite treat, a baby carrot!

EDIT to add, some people have told me I was wrong to bypass the system and should have waited for the landlord,.  I have no regrets, if they tried to evict me, I was planning on leaving anyhow, I just didn’t want to wait for another dog.  He has helped me get through losing my first dog

Edit 2.  I've had the dog since the end of August so almost 4 months.",Asshole,1
"Hello all. I just got into a fight with a friend and I feel really angry still, even though we already made up. I’m still upset. Am I justified in being upset or AITA?

If you are easily triggered, then please turn away now because the argument we had was about current events.

Hello all, I know I may get hate comments but if you have something productive to say, then please do. 

The argument we had were about the recent protests in the United States. We talked about it and I said I didn’t want to get involved because I have a lot going on in my life and I haven’t had the time to really look into it. 

For some reason, they took that as I didn’t care and I was being insensitive but I didn’t mean it like that. They spent about fifteen minutes telling me how much of an ass I was while I just sat there taking it. I understand completely how they feel and why they are upset but I didn’t mean to come off as insensitive, which I tried to say multiple times.

We talked after they calmed down and I apologized but they didn’t, cause they said they didn’t feel like they had to, which is fine, but it does rub me the wrong way. I don’t want to leave them but I don’t know, I just feel really upset and I may need a few days or so away from them.

I know I am wrong for not being educated and not trying to be educated, but that doesn’t mean I think the whole movement is wrong (which is something they also assumed). I just don’t know. I know I was wrong with how I said it (because I know it was a bit insensitive) but I just feel a bit angry about it. Like, I didn’t mean to come off as that and I apologized but that didn’t mean I needed to hear all that.

I even had to spend the next 15 minutes of them crying and I had to tell them it’s okay. You didn’t scare me away. I completely understand (which I do). But how they argued with me was something I don’t know if I can forgive right now. What do I do? Am I justified or am I being an ass?",Asshole,1

So GF and her best friend (M for short) have been living together for over a year and known each other since they were young. From the start, i never liked her best friend because right off the bat, she seemed too close to my gf. For example, I facetimed my gf and she was in her best friends bed watching a movie. I asked why she couldn’t sit elsewhere and she blew me off saying it wasn’t a big deal and if it bothered me so much she’d move. 

A few weeks back, i went with my gf to lunch with her friends and they were telling stories about each other and one friend brought up how GF and M had kissed each other before. Obviously that made me uncomfortable and i asked her after why she never told me and she said it was so long ago and only a dare. That she didn’t see the importance of telling me. I was still upset and she said i was overreacting.

And here this is his secret ""He has a crush on Gwen Stacy from the new spider man into the spider verse move"" and also no one has found out his secret and even of they did it wouldn't run his life he just has such a massive ego he doesn't have friends course he says oh I don't like anyone here that's a lie it's bc of his egotistical attitude Welp like I always say majority wins so tell me am I the assailed here?",Asshole,1
"I met this great girl from another country who lives around the neighborhood. We started hanging out and and have a great time together. We live in foreign country, we have the same religion and can speak english fluently.

Well, my english is not that great as I am not a native speaker and also from another country. So, talking with her is a like having a nice english speaking buddy.

One time when we were hanging out, she started asking me when am I going to get married. My family in my country is religious but they don’t rush me around about getting married. Plus, I’m still focusing on my career, and nobody interested in me yet. I’m sure my future husband is taking his sweet time to find me because I do am taking my time too. 

Then, she kept asking if I had past lover or someone. I’m sorry, girl but I never had one because I respect my religious self and I never had feeling to anyone. (I can’t help having silly crush, but I move on fast you know)

Then, she started asking if I even like men. I was baffled and hurt because of that question. (I know the world and reddit world is supporting all those lgbt rights right now, but I’m sorry, I don’t support it but we learn to agree to disagree, right. )That’s why it hurt me so much when asked me that question despite knowing my belief.

I’m sure she means well, so, I slowly try to forget about the issue after explaining how I do wishes to marry one day. Then, she kept pestering me to quickly get married, anyway which also irked me little by little.

Fast forward another time...

When people text me. I usually reply late. When people call, I don’t prefer to answer. Plus, writing and speaking english is hard when you are not a native speaker.

One time she asked me about some stuff where she could easily google it anyway when I was working at my job. So, I answered like two hours late because I only checked my phone during break.

I guess she was pissed of all the time I reply late to her and gave me a nice, “Thanks for the late reply”

I guess the work stress got me and I voiced how unfair when she gave me that message. Then, she voiced how I’m slow to reply because I didn’t care about her. 
Then she mentioned how I think that she have interest in me. Then quickly apologized for it. 

Why would somebody say that. Because she apologized, am i the asshole for not moving on from this issue. She is a married womann, for god’s sake.

Then, thank god for covid-19 because I asked her not to hang out with me anymore because I cant risk becoming close contact with anybody right now (and risk releasing potential lesbian energy to her, i guess)",Asshole,1
"So I [22M] told my girlfriend [21F] of a year and a half that I loved her for the first time about a year ago. 

She was the first girl I’ve ever been in a relationship with so I was super nervous. We’d been together about 4 months then. We’d grown pretty close pretty quickly, but I was still super nervous to say the three magic words out of fear of rejection. 

As such, I came up with the plan of waiting until she was absolutely blackout drunk one night to tell her. I did this so that if it went poorly, it would be very unlikely she’d remember. Eventually I had my chance and I told her. She responded positively. 

Like I thought, it didn’t seem like she remembered the next morning, so I told her again about a week later, this time while she was sober and she said it back. 

Well now over a year later, I told her what I’d done, and she’s really annoyed at me for doing it that way and not just saying it or outright to her. 

I just want to reiterate that I was super nervous and scared it may have been to soon back then so that’s why I did it. 

So AITA?

"Hello, first time reddit poster here. I (19F) live with my parents, (57M) and (52F). It is my mother's birthday tomorrow (Nov 7) and with my college work being fully virtual and the rest of 2020's shitshow, I forgot about her birthday. Yesterday (Nov 5) I bought myself an exclusive AC:NH Nintendo Switch, and 3 games for it. While I was out, I was too focused on getting to the store and getting home before rush-hour traffic to remember to stop and buy her something.This morning, I stepped outside to grab my package of games I had purchased and when I came back inside, my father told me that my mother had told him that I didn't care about her birthday. A few days prior to today, my mother came into my room and said something along the lines of ""Did you know its my birthday in a few days?"" and I said, ""No, I had forgotten.""I love giving gifts, I give gifts to my online social group all the time, we are frequently exchanging gifts and games with one another, and sometimes even physical care packages. My parents expect me to buy them gifts for their birthdays, and my father does not believe me that people forget birthdays. They mentioned how I never forget my friends' birthdays, and I made mention that I keep them in a calendar so it will remind me. I did not put my parents birthday in the calendar because my fathers is easy for me to remember, but I grew up with my parents always saying her birthday was on Election Day. Since Election Day changes year to year, I have never been able to memorize it properly, even after asking.Now my parents are accusing me of caring about my friends more than them, and I feel like I need to go out and get her something because they expect it of me. My father has nothing for my mother either, but she does not expect a gift from him. AITA?  


Edit: Thank you for all the comments! I was not expecting to get any so soon after posting. I can definitely see where I am the asshole here thanks to having other perspectives, and I will be going out later today to get her something, even if it is a little last minute. I love my mother and I definitely won't be forgetting her birthday, I added it to my personal calendar to make sure. I should have definitely put more effort into remembering.",Asshole,1
"Last week was my son’s birthday and he turned 11. He has wanted a Nintendo switch to play animal crossing for a long time and I bought him the bundle that came with Animal crossing.

He was really happy but it cost me a lot of money. 

I was scrolling on eBay and found a used Nintendo switch for about £80 cheaper. So when my son was asleep I packed away his nintendo switch with animal crossing and returned it back to the store when he was at school and bought the cheaper switch on eBay. The one on eBay didn’t come with any games. 

My son came back home from school looking for his switch and I told him that I found one cheaper and it’s coming through the post in a few days because it was cheaper. He was really upset but I told him that I saw that fortnite is a free game so he can play that and other free games too. He needs to understand the value of money because the switch and animal crossing was expensive. 

My wife is furious at me and calling me a frugal idiot and my son is very upset as he can’t play animal crossing with his friends, however I don’t see how this is a problem when I saved money and he can still find other games to play. My son needs to learn that he can’t get everything in life and needs to be grateful.",Asshole,1

"This past spring I bought an engagement ring for my girlfriend. It's a custom made ring that I spent weeks picking out.

Shortly after it arrived I got a bad concussion and wasn't in the state of mind to make big decisions for several months. In that time I told my girlfriend about the ring and my intentions with regard to it. It was, understandably, something she brought up when she was sad about my concussion ruining our plans.

I'm better now and have been thinking about how I might want to proceed. Last week she mentioned something about not wanting a disposable ring (she loses things so I got one that's in the hundreds of dollars not thousands of dollars so I could get a new one made without it being stressful for her) and instead wanting something I'd made myself.

This whole time I've been taking the ring out a few times a week. Putting it on one of my fingers. Thinking about how it represents how much I love her and thinking about how I really hope she likes it.

Given her comment about what she wanted in an engagement ring and how much history was on this ring now I decided to give it to her as a present (not a proposal) for our monthly anniversary. I figured with the election and everything she'd likely appreciate a concrete symbol of our love to ground herself with.

Unfortunately, though quite logically, she's seeing it as a symbol of me being inconsistent and maybe afraid of commitment.

Am I the asshole for repurposing her engagement ring into a normal present?",Asshole,1
"I (21M) and three of my old high school friends (21F,19M,22M) were out walking last night.

The street we were walking on has this pretty much resident homeless guy who sits around and asks everybody for money. 

He’s known to be extremely annoying because he tends to repeat“ excuse me” over and over again and trail after people. 

So lo and behold we walk past the dude and he goes at it with us. He smells bad and doesn’t even have a mask on and he leans a little towards me, which overfilled my nostrils with his stench. 

My friends are all rolling their eyes and I’m annoyed that he kept repeating excuse me louder as if I couldn’t hear.

So I decide to stick it to him. I stop and say “ what.”

He says “ do you have a dollar or two.” 

So I fish out my wallet and take out two singles, and look at them in my hand.

Then I look him straight in his eyes and shrug saying, “ huh, guess I do.”

And then I put the money back in my wallet and walk away and my friends start laughing and follow me. 

We end up going home and I tell my dad what we were cracked up over. And he says that was rude and I was being an asshat. But he never is around that particular street because it’s mostly full of college bars but it’s a persistent annoyance for me and my friends. 

I was hoping by showing I was no pushover that he’d know to stop bothering me and my friends.

"I (28F) have been with my boyfriend (28M) for over 5 years now and have been living together for 3 years. His parents cannot afford to pay for their office rent on top of their apartment rent, so they moved out and now secretly live in the office. They have their bed and basic kitchen appliances, a toilet and sink. They don't, however, have a bathtub. Prior to the pandemic, they've been going to local bathhouses/saunas to shower and do their laundry at their local laundromat. They don't have a car either, so my boyfriend had to chauffer them every week so they can run their errands. Now when the pandemic hit, everything in our city that is nonessential shut down. So every here and then, my boyfriend would ask me to leave the house for a few hours so his parents could come over to shower and do their laundry. I agreed the first time because at first my boyfriend made it sound like it would be a one time thing because his parents have been going over to a friend's house (but that week they were out of town). But it became more frequent and I've been getting annoyed each and every time. Yesterday we got into a huge fight because he thought I was being unempathetic when I said I'm sick of having to get kicked out of my own house so his parents can shower and do their laundry. I told him his parents need to be better and get out of their failing business, come up with a game plan, and acquire an apartment they can afford. I know easier said than done, but I said I would not allow it anymore if they continue to use us without having short and long term goals.

This is not something I can casually vent about to my friends or family because I want to protect my boyfriend and his parents' privacy. So here I am... AITA?

"Me and my brother are both on summer break, I'm 13, and he's 7. He goes to our grandma's house, and I stay at home, doing chores and whatnot. During the day, we don't really have much that I like, so my mom buys hot pockets. Well, sometimes I babysit him while ny mom and her fiancé go and do whatever in town, not a big deal.
He likes cold ravioli (odd I know) which we have PLENTY of. So anytime he wants to eat, I suggest Ravioli, mostly because I don't like it. He goes for hot pockets a lot though, which, like I mentioned, are the only thing I really feel like eating. My mom buys a 15 pack, and it goes within maybe a week or so. I typically eat cereal, then a hot pocket, so it can last 3 weeks (my mom cooks on weekends) but my brother drains the supply SO much.
I've expressed this to my mom, but she just says ""They aren't JUST for you"" in that mom voice we all know. I just want to eat during the week, but it's hard, because they go so fast. It's gotten to the point where I even hide them.",Asshole,1
"Kinda self explanatory. There was a rather large (around 4cm wide) spider on the wall in our house. 

My girlfriend and I are sleeping in separate rooms at the minute as she is self isolating as she has been in contact with someone with COVID, and the spider was in the room she is sleeping in. 

I volunteered to try and get rid of it, attempted, but failed and it fell onto the floor and I lost sight of it. I told her this and she said thank you for trying, but that she wouldn’t be able to sleep tonight now and that it wasn’t my fault.

Feeling bad for failing to catch it, I then pretended to catch sight of it, and slammed the mug on the ground, exclaiming that I found it. While she believed me at first I am a bad liar and when she questioned it I told a white lie confirming I did catch it, but quickly couldn’t help but confess. She then called me an “AH” for lying about it.

I only pretended to allow her to get some sleep as she is sick, but I do feel bad for lying and can to an extent see where she is coming from, even though it was a basically harmless little white lie.

So reddit, AITA?

Edit to clarify: I didn’t simply just confess immediately, I attempted to stick to my story of having caught it, and she said that she would be really upset with me if I was lying just to make her feel better. Obviously I was, but I didn’t think that was such a terrible thing over something so small.

"I (19 F) left home about 9 months ago after a mental breakdown. I won’t go into a lot of details about it, but it resulted in me in a different city in a hospital.  For context, I’m an Indigenous person and I was adopted by my mom when I was a few days old. My family is white, while I’m MUCH different with brown skin, black hair, and dark brown eyes. 9 months ago, I got into an argument with my mom after I attended a graduation party for one of my friends. I was talking about his family ( he is also Indigenous ) and a few things that were upsetting to see. No, I wasn’t making them out to be a bad family, or even close to insulting. My first mistake, because as much as I want to paint them out as good people, my mom and step dad are a little racist. Examples? One time we were eating dinner and the news was on, they were talking about an Indigenous University that was going to be built. With a sneer, my mom said and I quote “I’m so sick of hearing about them, they get everything for free”. I remember looking at her with disbelief. They’ve said many things, but that was one that stuck with me.


In all honesty, they probably thought it wasn’t a big deal. Things escalated, I was defending my friend and his family, and in anger I called my step dad white trash. Yes, I am an a**hole for that, but I don’t actually think that way about them. However, they were outraged by that and offended, which made me angry, because I was never able to be offended by anything they said. For example, I was told to not touch heads of “brown kids” because they had lice. She liked to call me Mowgli, as in The Jungle Book. She also told me that I looked homeless with my hair down and threatened to cut it, she actually did one time. 

At one point in the argument, my step dad said “You’re white, you were raised by white people”. I was beyond pissed, I screamed loudly at them. I’m a quiet, shy person and this was most likely the first time they ever heard me get so angry. I told my mom to not say racist stuff in front of me and she said  “No, I don’t have to do that. You’re different.” 

I left afterwards and that led to my hospitalization. When I called them, my mom sounded…annoyed? As if I just inconvenienced them with my “tantrum” and after that, I left the hospital on my own and came back to pack all my stuff, then I left. My mom did text with the usual “I gave you everything” messages. I told her my feelings and how I felt through text messages. She called me an ungrateful b**** and said she wished she never adopted me. 

I did tell her, the day I left, that she wasn’t even my real mom. It was out of anger, I haven’t said anything like that since I was a little kid. I can understand that I was the a**hole with that comment, but I never did know what I did to get such a reaction out of her. My older siblings have done far worse than having a mental breakdown, but that was all it took for my mom to tell me to leave.

"For context, I (29 F) and my husband 35(M) has been married for 6 years.

My husband has recently resigned from his 12 years of work 6 months ago to focus on his business. He’s aware he’ll be losing all of his government benefits including health insurance.

His business makes a decent amount of money more than my current work of 2 jobs. We also split house bills 50/50.

Before he left his work, I added all of our children as my dependents (2 kids) in my health insurance (HMO) benefit in which I can add up to 2 dependents free in my current work. To make things safe for any medical expenses whilst he has no work, my husband initiated to be added as my dependent where he will be paying his health insurance since all my free slots has been used for our kids. In summary, I also added him as another dependent and he’s paying the monthly charge for his health insurance.

Today, my husband and I were strolling the mall whilst talking about our bill expenses.

He blurted out that “he shouldnt be paying for his Healthcare Insurance” and I should be the one paying for it since I’m the one working. He said if things were reversed, he’ll not let me pay my health insurance if he was in my position

However, I’m wondering why I should be the one paying his medical insurance IF HE was the one to decide that he wants to quit work and focus on his business? Why should I have that burden when I am already covering all my kids health insurance? He makes a decent money from his business so why after 6 months of resigning he’s the one pressuring me to pay his health insurance even if he can pay it himself?

"This story involves me (f15) and my cousins, who I’ll call Red (m14), Red’s sister Purple (f13), and Blue (m11). 

We were all at a park when Blue made a fat joke towards Purple. The joke was “the only thing that revolves around you is body fat”. Purple got offended and we calmly explained three times to Blue why what he said was wrong. He didn’t really understand what we were saying, but he had a really sheltered upbringing with one hour of screen time a day, strict parental controls, and has been homeschooled his whole life by religious parents so he didn’t know why the joke was bad. However, Red did not have the same upbringing. He was raised in the American public school system with no limit on his screen time and no parental controls at all. Red knew what his joke meant and kept telling Purple that it was “just a joke and to not take it so deep”.

Red and Purple started arguing, and the argument escalated to Purple explaining to Red and Blue that she has had a close friend with an eating disorder, mental health issues, and who has almost control+alt+deleted herself. She did this to give them perspective on how jokes like that are bad and can really affect someone‘s mental health. At this point, Blue started to kind of understand that it was bad, but you know what Red said? Womp womp. At this point I got really pissed and we walked back to the house we were at.

Purple told Blue’s mom what happened so that she could help him understand better. I had to tell the rest of the adults (Red and Purple’s mom, their other sister, Blue’s mom, our grandma, my mom, and another aunt). 

After that, Purple talked to her sister and Blue and Red got an earful from Blue’s mom. After everyone calmed down, Blue and Purple had a long discussion where they talked it out a Blue apologized for what he said. During this, however, Red kept trying to interject, saying “you did nothing wrong” “don’t apologize” to Blue and “so you took a joke out of context“ to Purple. It got to the point that even Blue had to tell him “Can you not say anything else until we have this sorted out so you don’t rip it apart again?” Red was finally quiet until they got it sorted out but he kept going on and on about it after it was over. Purple got fed up and said some personal things that I won’t say in this post out of respect of her privacy. After Purple said this Red got quiet and left the room. He has not apologized for anything he said.

The next day, I was talking about how I was pissed at Red for what he said and did, and my aunt told me that I should just forgive him and not hold a grudge. But I’m still very upset with him and how immaturely he handled this. It just shocks me how an 11 year old could have a more adult conversation than him. I’m just looking for a second opinion here.

"Hello, I am a senior in high school and I’m also in theater. The story im about to tell you happened earlier in the school year, but is still a problem.

At my school we have a room most high schools have called a green room, it is usually attached to the theater and this is where I spend most my time. There is this girl, we will call her sally,  in theater who I was very good friends with throughout my childhood, but this year she has changed, and I will not name her out of privacy and respect.

One day I needed to use the restroom before I had to do something for choir, I told sally I was going to use the restroom quick, and decided to use the girls dressing room bathroom. Now to me this didn’t seem to be a problem because our director keeps it open to anyone during the day, and he uses it as well. When I was walking in she filmed me and told everyone I was using the restroom, which made me very uncomfortable.

The next day my friend and I went down to the green room and he had to use the restroom, he went into the girls dressing room as well, and I didn’t think anything of it, as it has never been a problem before. The next period I went down there again (I practically live there). Right as I got down there sally asked why I peed on the floor, which I didn’t, but she wouldn’t give up. I then told her that I didn’t even use that restroom, and told her my friend used it the period before. Sally then told me that we all know it was you and your just to embarrassed to admit it.

Fast forward to about three days ago, I was standing In the green room minding my own business, and sally goes, “well well well, if it isn’t my least favorite person.” I was shocked, she said it right in front of my face, she then went on to say how she would be super relived in 3 months when so would never have to see me again.

I have been fed up with sally and took it to my director. I could see how I’m the AH, because I do realize that it is the girls dressing room, but if it was that big of a deal I feel the director shouldn’t keep it open for everyone. Personally it sucks that I got accused of something I didn’t do but no matter what I say or do no one can believe me.

Anyways I want to say thanks for reading, and that leads me to my last question, AITA?

"This is probably half rant, half senior moment

My nearby grocery store has taken to asking every shopper to show their receipts before being allowed to leave.

My take is that the shoplifting is partly their own fault because they got rid of most of their cashiers and made everyone scan and bag their own groceries. 

I had an incident a month ago, where the scanner malfunctioned. The cashier came over, looked at my bag and accused me of stealing an item. She hadn’t bothered to look at the display to see if I had scanned it. I had, and pointed to it on the display. “I wasn’t done reading it,” she protested. 

“Then why accuse me of stealing first before you checked the display?” I countered. 

My solution, I thought, was to go through one of the few cashier stations so there would be no question that all my items had been scanned.

Not good enough. The security guard asked for my receipt as I was leaving. I had 3 very full bags and was not going to stand there while he checked every single item. I told him the next time I would dump out my grocery bags so he could check every item.

I’m tired of being treated like a thief, and I know he’s just doing his job, but when the job is to treat every customer like a thief I get pretty annoyed.

"Kind of an innocuous situation but let's see what general consensus is here. 

To set up the scene: 
I've been coming to this diner by my apartment pretty much every weekend since I've moved in. I'm an evening worker so I tend to come in later in the evening or even the middle of the night but after a schedule change at work I've been going during more peak times. The entrance of the restaurant is like a set of doors, a little area, and then another set of doors into the main restaurant. On the right is the hostess stand and then to the left is some claw machines and seating for people waiting to get a table. 

The interaction: 
I walk in and see they're very busy, multiple families on the seats, and a couple standing on the mats in front of the entrance. I assume there's a que and post up for a second. I'm there for a couple of minutes before a large family comes in, I make room for them to come in and the hostess notices them and does that nod thing you do to acknowledge someone so they walk up to check in. Seeing this I ask the couple ""Are you two not waiting to check on"" the dude responds ""No were waiting on a table."" 

I'm hungry and now annoyed so try a little customer service voice and throw out ""Oh well maybe don't stand in front of the door, makes it look like it's a line."" He quips back ""Or you could just go up and ask"" and I give a quick ""It's rude to cut in lines yeah?"" And he responds back ""Yeah..."" 

Is it rude to stand within 5 feet of a door to a restaurant once you've checked in or am I just being a dicky eater?

"I (24F) have a sister (26F) that just got proposed to by her 1 year long boyfriend (27M). In the past my sister used to date masculine looking buff men, the military type essentially, while her fiance is much more feminine than all of her exes, wearing earrings on both ears, having painted nails and even being shorter in height than my sister. Don't get me wrong, he's definitely still cute, but if you'd knew my sister, you'd definitely wouldn't expect her to date someone as feminine as her fiance.

When they announced their engagement I expressed my surprise over my sister getting married to someone that isn't her usual type. My sister said that I'm wrong and that her fiance is her perfect type on paper. I laughed a bit over this comment and she asked me what was so funny. I told her that everyone knows her type are masculine military looking men as that's how all of her exes look like and that her fiance is the outliner in her dating history.

My sister that all her exes are exes cause they weren't her actual type and then her fiance said something about how thinks he can be as masculine for his girl as these dudes were, at which I laughed again. At this point both my sister and her fiance start getting defensive and calling me disrespectful and accuse me of pot stirring in order to ruin their engagement announcement and even our mom took their side, telling me that I shouldn't have brought up her past exes just as my sister announced that she's getting married.

Personally I don't think what I said should've been that big of a deal and I think both my sister and fiance got defensive over my sister only liking masculine dudes in the past, which are clearly the complete opposite of her fiance and our mom was just trying to defuse the tension cause she knows my sister is usually the sensitive one in our family.

"Throwaway for obvious reasons

My brother is getting married to his childhood sweetheart soon. I didn't like the whole idea of the wedding because they're practically still kids and it would be dumb for them to get married so young. Our parents (ours and hers) are pretty pissed about it too but going along with it anyway because they were worried they might just elope and go NC otherwise.

Also, I'm in love with his fiancee. We all sort of grew up together (neighbours for 5 years when we were teens, parents close friends now etc) and she always had a big crush on me, but I ignored it because she was a kid, and really annoying, but her and my brother were always best friends because they were the same age. We had a bit of a thing when we were like 18/16, but again, I thought she was too young and also I was dealing with a lot of personal shit  at the time so I ended up pushing her away and making her think I didn't want her because I didn't want to hurt her worse in the long run, even though I kind of did start to really like her. I guess I thought she'd just be there when I was ready or something because she'd always been so obsessed with me.

Cue my freaking brother riding in on his white horse when I broke things off with her and them getting together, which was always his gameplan I think. FF four years, and apparently they're getting married. She's more religious than us and they've always done the purity ring bullshit so obviously my brother just got bored of waiting and wants to get married now so he can get laid. I don't think he's good enough for her and I never did, especially in the light of what I know now.

Anyway, my brother got really drunk the other night and told me that when they broke up for a while (I don't know why they broke up but I remember he was really cut up about it) last year he fucked someone else just before they ended up getting back together and he was going on to me about how bad he felt about it and how he didn't know she was going to take him back when he did it and he wished he hadn't (whatever, dick). I don't think she knows what he did, and I don't think she would marry him if she knew he'd  gone and cheated on her when they were broken up, especially if they are doing the whole no sex before marriage. 

WIBTA if I told her what he did, and told her how I really feel about her and maybe stopped the wedding? I really think she's my soulmate and that deep down she probably wants to be with me too she just doesn't know I'm in love her/still an option or that he's just a cheat? If I love her too I should tell her, right? She might want to be with me instead.",Asshole,1
"English isn't my 1st language, execuse me for any mistakes
I apologize in advance if this is too long, so there's a TL;DR at the end

I (16f) live with my parents and brother (20m, Ben).
I don't have a great relationship with my parents (especially my father), and can't stand my brother anymore.
They're both very judgemental and I try to avoid them both. I also can't study in front of them and rarely ask for anything due to the pressure i feel when I'm in the same room as them or talk to them. 

I'm not close to my brother since he is very mean to me, as he always tries to take me down, never lets me speak without constantly making fun of me, and has recently started to tell me that he hates me. I was the first one he told this, he later procedeed to hate more things and people. 
He doesn't mean it, but damn, it hurts every time. 

IMPORTANT: this week, i haven't been able to stay in my room because my father and Ben are painting it.
Also because i work 2hs a day and cook for myself and try to maintain a social life, so i don't have time to be there.
The day they started, I got an assignment which includes a big project which requires a desk and at least 3 hours. I made it clear that I needed my desk on sunday (today) and after arguing a bit, they told me i could have it. 

Yesterday (Saturday) i was at my grandma's (mom's side) and almost the whole family was there (my father was not, due to other issues). 

Ben told me (during lunch, in front of all of the family) I couldn't get my desk and to just do the assignment in another room. I replied i didn't want solutions, i just wanted my room and my desk for 3/5 hours. 
He replied telling me he hates me. 
Most of my family told me I was childish, kept giving me stupid solutions, told me i have zero capacity of adapting to situations and that I was the asshole for ""imposing"" (I've actually just asked them) to give me my desk. Only my uncle, my boyfriend and ben's girlfriend were on my side. 

i started feeling overwhelmed and went crying in the bathroom.

After a bit, and my bf trying to calm me, i went back to the table and they kept me giving solutions so I've told them to shut up and change topic. 
The third time i requested it, they finally stopped. 

They all say I was the asshole because i didn't want to make this project under pressure and because I ""forced"" my father and brother to give me my desk. 
Also, my mother is blaming me for crying amd said I overreacted.

Are they right? AITA? 

TL;DR: I asked my father and brother to give me my desk and my room (I need it for an assignment). Now, most of my family is saying that I'm childish and can't adapt to situations because i feel too uncomfortable to do it in the living room. AITA?

"Context:
- My friend her wedding is today (it has started already).

- She invited me because we are good friends. But we have a one-on-one friendship. All of her other friends are part of a whole group. Because everything is so expensive, I wasn’t invited with a plus one. And I’ve only seen some of her other friends once. So I am really alone here. 

- I have a knee injury and can’t stand for too long. 

Current situation:
- The official wedding at the courthouse and the ceremony are finished. We now have 30 minutes before the reception starts and after 1,5h the diner starts.

- Reception and diner are standing. So I can either force myself amongst groups of people (who I don’t know) or I can stand alone. (It would be easier if diner was at a table, because then I wouldn’t have to force myself into a group. Everybody at the table just talks to each other)

- I just went to sit in my car for a bit (because of my knee) and now I’m thinking to go eat some ice cream instead of going to the reception…

So: WIBTA if I skipped the reception to go eat some ice cream, let my knee rest, let my social battery charge instead of going to the reception? 

EDIT: I don’t think I was very clear in my initial post. I took my pain medication in my car and I am going back to the wedding (at the latest) for diner. I was just wondering if it would be bad to stay away a little while longer than expected. ",Asshole,1
"Little bit of background: me and my now fiancée moved in together 2 years ago. We have been in the same apartment this whole time. On basically the first night we lived together, we heard some banging and thought one of our neighbors might be making love. We laughed it off and went to bed. The next morning the banging persisted. I ignored it, but my fiancée wanted to explore the noise further. A few days later, she found the source and told me about it. It turns out that the plunger in the back of my toilet that should shut when the back of the toilet is filled with water was too short to fully cover the hole, and that allowed water to fall into the toilet when it shouldn’t, causing the water valve to kick on since it would sense that the back of the toilet was low on water. Typically this isn’t a huge issue for it to turn on and off, but when it is doing it constantly, it creates a loud banging noise. I’m not 100% why this is, but my best guess is something to do with the pipes. I told her I would take a look at it, but being forgetful and being able to block out almost any noise made me completely forget about it.

Fast forward about a year, my fiancée starts showing symptoms of schizophrenia, and I took her to the ER for an evaluation. She believed she heard our neighbors saying they were going to kill her. She spent some time in a mental health facility, and that was very very hard for both of us. We got engaged shortly after she got out of the mental health facility, and I swore I would do anything to make sure she was safe. 

Fast forward again to a couple nights ago. We are sitting in our living room and talking. We had a bit of an awkward exchange and things got quiet. I started to hear a loud banging and asked if she heard that. She responded explaining the toilet thing again and about how she has heard that nonstop for the last 2 years. She didn’t seem super angry about it, more frustrated that I was just now noticing again. I got up, tried to fix it, but couldn’t and ended up just shut off the water to that toilet until maintenance can come and fix it. She shared with me how nice it was to have silence again and how relaxed she felt. I couldn’t help but break into tears because I realized that this could have been fixed a lot sooner if I had just listened to her more. She never seemed to get angry and rather thanked me for finding a solution, even if it’s a temporary one. Maybe I’m just overthinking, but I feel such incredible guilt over it.

"I’m sorry if there’s any mistakes english isn’t my first language 

My daughter (16f) was always very loud about her femininity, she always had glitter on her, her favorite color was pink, she had bows in her hair, skirts and dresses were her favorites clothes, she was very gentle and shy, she was like those princesses from the books.

Almost a year ago she started to change, slowly she stopped wearing pink, dresses and skirts and went to over sized pants and t-shirts. She stopped wearing makeup and it was rare to see any color on her that wasn’t dark. I tried to talk to her but she would just shut me out, she became a different person. I put her in therapy and it had helped a little but not by much. I didn’t know what to do anymore so I just let her be but made sure that I was there for her and to continue her therapy.

Two days ago my daughter finally broke down and admitted that her brother has been picking on her and laughing about her. She said he kept talking about the sentence “lipstick on a pig” around her.

I was shocked, I never thought my son would act like that but I knew she was telling the truth from the pain in her eyes.

When my son came back home that day I told him that my daughter told me what he did and that he’s grounded until his 18th birthday (it’s in 5 months), I took his phone and computer and told him that he would get his phone before school and that I will take it back when I get home (I get home around the same time as him since he have a long school day and basketball practice). 

He tried to protest but I just asked him if she was lying and he wouldn’t answer me so I took that as a yes and hasn’t talked to him since except for when I have too.

I don’t know how to deal with all of this, my daughter seems to get worse since I grounded her brother but she has told me that he hasn’t talked to her since and that she just feel bad.

I’m starting to feel bad too, both of my kids are miserable now, I’m barley talking to my son and I don’t know how to even begin to explain this to my family since my husband side of the family has heard about this and has been sending me angry text along with my SIL coming to my house to scold me about not listening to his side.

My husband supports my punishment but he works long hours and isn’t home too much so it’s all up to me.

"So I (13f) have a confusing relationship with my mom (41f). She's always felt more like a sibling to me than a mother, oddly. I have no clear way of explaining it without getting personal, other than she's rather open about certain things. 

Basically what I think is happening is that she's slightly favoring my brother (15m) over me. I don't think it's too serious, but I do tend to loose a bit of sleep over it. Basically, my brother tends to get 2 bottles of 2 different brands of drinks everytime we go out shopping, and sometimes an additional drink, but I'm only allowed one drink once in a while. 

Not only this, I've also realized that in the past, by brother has gotten expensive gaming consoles and games while I usually just get a lot of cheap art supplies and clothes. Of course, I am greatful for the gifts since they do usually help from time to time in art, but there's a clear difference in quality. I've asked my brother about this, he claims it's because he's obvious about what he wants. For some background about me, I've been a pretty life fan of undertale since around 2016. And yet no matter how many times I've told them about how much I've wanted some type of merch of undertale, I've never received anything of it. But my brother can get a whole gaming set up because he asked??

For the past few months, I've been wanting to learn how to play drums and finally found in person classes in my town. One hour, 3 times a week. I'm working from home, have no kids, it's not a huge time commitment.

I was very excited and told Matt about this and he was less than impressed. He basically told me I was too old to go play a kids instrument and what's the point of going, I was too old to be in a band or anything.

I said that it was because I've always wanted to do it because it looks like fund and like something I would really enjoy.

he then told me he thought it would be a waste of money and I am an adult in a committed relationship, I shouldn't spend so frivolously. 

Honestly, it made me feel like shit but I dropped it.

But later on, we went to a pub with some of our friends and he started making fun of me saying things like 'guess what she wanted to do, isn't that ridiculous' and some friends agreed with him while others tried to defend me.
I told him he was an ass and left the pub to go home. Haven't spoken to him since but he sent me text messages that I humiliated him in front of our friends and that I was the asshole and had to apologize.

"I 20(f) am dating my current partner 28(M) we have been dating for 2 years, going ok 3 years this fall. 
When we first started dating he was in the process of buying his first vehicle. I 18(f) at the time only had my g1.  Still do. Keep in mind we don’t live in a city and we don’t have busses but we do have taxis. 

One of the first things he asked me after getting his truck is if I had any plans to get my full license. 
At the time I did entirely want my license. However as I had told him and everyone in my family already knew. I was terrified of driving. 
He on the other hand really wanted me to learn in what he thought would be a comfortable environment. 
I had previously had issues with favours like this being used against me. However reluctantly I accepted his offer to teach me how. 
At first it was going okay, but we were having issues in our relationship at the time and had a hard time keeping it from lessons. 

One day about half a year into learning how to drive. -At this point I was somewhat confident enough on the road. But no where in close (in my mind at least) to being able to do the road test.- He asks me to drive. I had just got done a 12 hour shift but he had just drove an hour to get me (he doesn’t have a job and hasn’t for two years keep that in mind) and wanted a break. 
So reluctantly I agreed. After picking up my stuff and dropping off work related things we began the drive to his place. 

I’ve never been the best with directions, and it had been brought up in discussion I do better with a gps that can tell me before the turn. And repeat it. 
The turn itself doesn’t matter but my boyfriend was getting upset with me because he kept having to repeat directions. And on top of that. He had to pee so when I asked him what way to turn again he snapped. And I panicked. Instead of turning right like usual  I made the decision to turn left onto the dead end road (where he could pee) but due to the rain and my tiredness I wasn’t able to stop and slow down enough for oncoming traffic and slid into it. 
I totalled the vehicle and when I think about it, it still scares me. I’m uneasy in vehicles now. And after that I made it clear i wouldn’t be getting my license. As I was too anxious to be on the road. 
I also replaced the vehicle flat out, full price and without help.  

To this day my partner refuses to accept that I didn’t want my license. Not after being through something so scary and all the comments about how he shouldn’t of ever let me drive the truck from his family.  
I would also like to point out. We almost broke up at the beginning of the year but we worked it out. And he said he would try to better in treating me well. 
However he still brings it up Everytime I’m upset with his actions. Or his behaviour is out of line. 
Whenever I bring up the narcissistic behaviour and how certain major things haven’t changed.  He brings up that when we first started dating I’d promised to get my license.  And now that I’m not he has to do all the driving. 
But for my own piece of mind I must ask. Am I the asshole for not getting my license?",Not the A-hole,0
"My husband and I had an arranged marriage and we've been married 6 months now. Before the wedding I had explained my personality traits, likes, dislikes and career choice to my husband and he was accepting of everything. We have polar opposite personalities and likes, but we decided to go ahead based on trust and mutual respect. 

After the wedding my MIL began having conservative expectations from me (cooking, cleaning, chores etc.) even though there was maid at home. None of these things were expected from my husband because he's the ""guy"". My FIL was an alcohol addict. My career was my first priority. After some stressful events I demanded to my husband that we move out. 

After moving out I took up almost 80% of household chores and expected 20% from my husband. Neither of us cook so we got a tiffin service. After about 10 days my husband started expecting me to cook, do all chores and change many of my habits according to his wish. When I rebelled saying I had made clear before the wedding that I wouldn't be cooking, and I expected at least 30% housework from him he stopped talking to me, started ignoring me and reduced his contribution to chores to 5%

I claimed this was emotional abuse, and asked him we see a marriage counselor. He denied. My parents and FIL say they know he's in the wrong but also say I'm too stubborn. They say they understand my side but since he earns almost 7 times more than me (even though I work 6 hrs a day, and he 8) I am not privileged to demand anything from him, and must do all household work and cook (basically give in to all his demands) until I start earning as much or more than him. I still think I'm not being too stubborn, and no matter how much money we both contribute towards the house, he has no right to demand things from me which I had cleared up that I won't be doing, well before the wedding. 

If he doesn't come for marriage counselling, and work on himself, I've declared that I will eventually file for divorce. All our family members think I'm overreacting. AITA?",Not the A-hole,0

i feel a weight lifted off my shoulders since i have left, i am now in therapy to try and process everything i had gone through while living with her. now, i’ll be honest i don’t really talk to my mom as much as i probably should because it always ends up with her starting an argument of why i haven’t called her/why i don’t come over.

"English is not my first language. I apologize in advance for any grammatical or spelling errors.

I (31M) own a condo unit. Currently, no one lives there since me, my wife (33F), and our baby (0M) transferred to a new house that my wife got on a mortgaged. Also, my SIL (16) lives with us as well.

My wife used to live with her brother (25) and their sister in an apartment. When they were living together, my BIL only pays a 1/3 of the rent. He doesn't even share the expenses on utilities. He does buy food, but mostly it's for himself. In short, my wife shoulders most of the household expenses on top of cleaning their apartment. And, she also pays for her sister's education. To add, my wife also paid for my BILs college education.

When my wife and her sister moved out of the apartment, my BIL decided to live with their mom. And yes, free rent.

Now to the dilemma. You should know that my condo is in a touristy area. My wife and I thought that once this pandemic is over, and tourists starts pouring in, renting out my condo can surely help our finances. When my BIL learned that my condo is vacant, he asked my wife if he can live there without paying rent and confidently assured her that he'll pay the condo dues and the utilities.

I immediately laughed when my wife told me this. I told her that he should pay rent. And my wife agrees. We even decided to give him a discounted rate because, after all, he's family (only $180/month + fees and utilities, and near the beach/resorts). But he's not all too enthused.

"  I (25f) and my husband (30m) took our daughter (2years) to the splash pad today. We were the only ones using it for a few minutes before another mom and her 3 year old appeared. Our littles were happily playing for about 20-30 mins before a larger group of 10 or so kids from a kids birthday party showed up. The youngest appeared to be around 8 and the oldest was probably 12-13.
  Now, I have no issues with bigger kids using the splash pad. There’s nothing wrong with it. However, when a group of bigger kids all hyped up on sugar shows up, I know my 2 year old can easily be overlooked and knocked down. The mom of the 3 year old obviously felt that way too because she ended up leaving. We stayed for a few more minutes to see how these bigger kids would play around my daughter.
  She ended up being almost trampled and knocked over, like I thought, so I went over and asked her if she wanted some juice and to go for a walk around the park. Obviously she was sad. She cried, but seemed to be alright after I dried her off and put her shoes on. She loves walking the trails around the park.
  However, some lady with the group of bigger kids said something along the lines of, “Let her play. You don’t have to leave because of us!”
  I smiled and said, “Thanks, but it’s okay. I was wanting to go for a walk.” I’m heavily pregnant and needed the walk anyways.
  She seemed to get annoyed. She kept saying “My kids are good with little kids.” And “She still wants to play.” And “You’re not showing her how to play with other kids.”
  Finally I said, “Your kids might be great with little ones, but she’s very small compared to everyone else. She could easily get hurt. She plays with other kids just fine. We are going for a walk. Goodbye!”
  My husband was giving daughter a piggy back ride down the hill to the trail. She was literally paying no mind to the splash pad anymore.

 As we were walking away, she was still complaining to the other parents/adults about how we were treating her kids. AITA for removing my daughter from that situation?",Not the A-hole,0
"I (20F) have a roommate (21F) who I have been living with for about 3 months. She is very friendly and sweet, always pays bills on time, and is altogether a fine person to live with. The one problem I have is that she has the worst, most sour, body odor I have ever smelled. It is noticeable on her physical body, as well as coming out of her bedroom when she leaves the door open, but it’s most pungent in the bathroom because it seems to come directly off of her towels, which are hung on the towel rack next to the toilet. I have tried air fresheners, opening windows, keeping the bathroom fan on, nothing works. I haven’t said anything because I know this is a sensitive matter but it’s so unpleasant.

"Throwaway for anonymity, mobile use so my apologies for any formatting issues.

Very recently my mother passed after a long time fighting her aging body and long term issues thanks to covid. She had been on the downturn for a while, but she still passed in an unexpected way due to a fall. 

I'm currently stuck in another country for work so my brother has to handle the arrangements. She was specific in what she wanted so it's all very simple. However my brother is angry at the way that she passed and wants to have an autopsy done. 

I don't. First, I'm the one footing the bill for all of the arrangements, and second but most important is that...she wouldn't want that. The thought of doing that to her is absolutely horrid, and it's just...not fair if that makes sense. It's for their comfort and peace of mind, not for her. 

My brother wants me to pay the extra 2k for the full workup, etc, but I don't want to. I've refused, and now him and his wife and the family who knows are ticked off at me and are calling me the AH because of it.

"     My(26F) aunt(35) and I are close in age and have always been very close. She has been dating the same guy(40M, I’ll call him Steve) for ten years. Everyone loved Steve when they first got together, but over the years, especially the last three to five, things have gotten even rockier for them. Loads of drinking, Steve has been abusing pills and has a gambling problem despite hardly working, and even though he knows my aunt wants to get married and have kids, doesn’t want those things, which is fine to not want, but I feel like he’s stringing her along! My aunt finally decided to get sober back in 2020. Everyone was so supportive. It lasted a year, and she is back to heavily drinking, and Steve is back to gambling and drinking with her. Their codependency and mutual drinking really worries me for the sake of my aunt whom I love very much. 
Fast forward to a few weeks ago, I go to a concert for my mom’s birthday with my mom and husband. My aunt wanted to surprise her and decorate the hotel room while we were gone. Upon arriving back to the hotel and stepping off the elevator onto our floor, we hear horrible fighting and shouting. I was the first to walk in and I saw Steve hunched over the table for an extended period of time, and when I made it aware that I was there, he looked horrified. His eyes were wide, and he was bright pink. When we all got in the room, they did their best to act like they were fine, but Steve avoided eye contact, was fidgeting bad, and kept going to the bathroom with the fan on. I’ve seen people do drugs, I don’t know how I could ever be mistaken. My husband agreed he seemed to be on something. I also saw Steve, when no one was looking, quickly grab a small bag off the dresser. Later, my husband said he saw him wiping the table he had been at. 
The next day, I told my mom what I had seen and expressed concern for my aunt. My mom said she was in agreement that something was off and had heard him snorting in a bathroom on their last vacation.  This has started a huge fight amongst my family members,
 and my aunt and her boyfriend who swear up and down that he wasn’t doing drugs. My aunt basically called me an a**hole and said I shouldn’t lie and tell people something so serious if I’m not actually sure. And now I’m questioning myself. Did I FOR SURE see drugs? Am I imagining his behavior due to previous experiences? My aunt made it very clear that I have caused issues now and that her fight with my mom is because of what I “thought” I saw. 
I still feel justified in saying something. I don’t think I was wrong. Her relationship is toxic and it’s hard for me to sit back and watch her life crumble from alcohol and a codependent, financially and emotionally abusive boyfriend. AITA? Should I not have said anything at all? Am I crossing a line? 
I also want to add, he has a “bad back” and they spend a lot of money on muscle relaxers??? Is that NOT abusing drugs?",Not the A-hole,0
"I know this title sounds confusing and completely entitled, so please hear me out. And if this story seems to crazy to be true, welcome to my life…

I’ve been working for the same small retail place for the past 6 years while in high school and college. I made my way up to manager. My younger sister started working there a few years ago. She is now also a manager. A few months ago my sister broke up with her boyfriend (also a manager, gotta love it…) out of the blue and moved out of our house. We really didn’t know where she was. Turns out she’s been shacking up with our boss twice her age. This has caused so much tension it deserves a post on its own, but that’s another story. 

Basically every year the managers get a dollar raise to compensate for our state’s minimum wage going up every year (basically so the managers don’t make the same as the new kids). Well this year my raise was only $.50. I told my sister I was going to ask for the other half (obviously from her boyfriend, the owner). She then chuckled and said “you think he has the money to pay you that?” It was insulting, degrading, and quite frankly, a fucking lie. I told her that if I didn’t then I would have to try and retrieve the thousands they illegally (I’ve checked with attorneys) underpaid me as per our union contract. She flipped out and basically said “you better not sue my boyfriend”. 

WIBTA if I sued my sisters boyfriend? I totally understand that this is just kinda asking for drama between my sister and I. But my position is that I never asked for any of this; I never asked to be cheated out of money and I never asked for my sister to start dating my boss.",Not the A-hole,0
"My (25F) boyfriend (35M) have been together for 4 years. He’s more of a closed off person and isn’t good with  emotions. For example, he didn’t tell his family he got his ex pregnant until halfway into her pregnancy because he didn’t want his family in his business. I can be an emotional person, I am bipolar, and I have to be medicated. I was recently laid off from my job and lost my health insurance, so I lost my medication, so it’s been a struggle emotionally and mentally. 

Yesterday, I wasn’t able to wash my bedding since my apartment’s laundry mat flooded. The other option is a laundry mat about 10 minutes away (by car), but I have no gas in my car because I can’t afford to fill it up until I get my unemployment check. I told my bf, as he hates when my pets’ hair gets on my bed and has to sleep in it, and said it may work better the next day to come over or to wait until later that night (he typically stays the remainder of the week and weekend). That way, my mom could come pick up my bedding and wash it for me at her house once she got back from work and bring it to me. Either way, the next day would’ve been the latest. I told him my issue, and compounded with everything else going on, I was more upset than usual. He told me I was being too emotional and that he doesn’t see what the problem is. He told me that he has coins so he could use a coin laundry if he needed to, there’s no excuse to not be able to do laundry and have this affect our day.” Then he said I was just making this into a problem to not see him on purpose and said “Whatever, see you whenever.” And hung up on me.

I tried texting him to apologize and that I wasn’t saying to not come over at all, but just that the situation needs to get figured out first before I can agree on a time he can come over. He refuses to answer my texts and leaves me on read. He comes over every other weekend when he doesn’t have his kids, and he stays for days or a whole week, so I’m more than happy to spend time with him. I just thought giving a heads up was a good idea so we can plan better. AITA?

Edit: after much consideration and really taking to heart much of your advice, I have decided to end this relationship. I don’t see him for a few days, so that will give me time to decompress and get myself together at least. But it will be over once we have a discussion. I’ve spent 4 years with him, and nothing to show for it, and I enough to deal with my mental illness, especially with no partner support. I think this was my last ditch effort to maybe just see if I were hysterical and rightly upset him. Thank you kind redditors, I truly appreciate your input.",Not the A-hole,0

Since the new person started my job has been hellish. This person completely lacks the skill set to do this job and lied about pretty much everything regarding their experience. I of course understand there is a learning curve to any new job but this person clearly had 0 experience and is very slow at learning and makes a TON of mistakes. I have spent the last 6 months undoing everything that this person does and doing it again correctly which has only added to my workload and is massively frustrating. I am completely worn out. 

Everybody loves this persons personality and everybody gets along with them whilst I find it incredibly difficult not to resent them.

I have raised my concerns multiple times with my superior but due to the loveable nature of this person no notice is being taken.

I went to visit my dad (55m) at his. I saw his stepson, let’s call him Tom (38m) do something really really bad. I told my dad and the people involved if they wanted to go to the police that I would help them and give them a statement and I back them up 100%. My dad at first backed me up, but soon caved to his wife, let’s call Sarah (54f). 

They both began telling me I didn’t know what I saw and because I was so young I didn’t know what I was talking about. My dad then started saying I wasn’t in my right mind and wasn’t thinking straight. His wife also said stuff along the line of I hope you get put in prison for slander and false accusations (despite only telling my dad). My dad also said stuff like I ruined his marriage, this was all my fault and he wanted me gone.

I soon left and since he has been very apologetic and been super nice in order to make up for it.

"Please tell me (25M) if I was out of line for calling my brother (24M) a groomzilla. 

My brother Jay is getting married and I can't believe how he and his soon to be wife Sandra are acting. My sister Mel (21F) has been working at a salon for the last year as a junior stylist and she is licenced as a hairdresser, as a nail technician and as a makeup artist. Jay asked Mel if she would do the nails of Sandra, the wedding party and both mothers before the wedding and their hair and makeup on the day of. Mel said she would put together a price and find a couple of others from the salon to do it with her. Jay and Sandra said no because they are expecting Mel to do all of it herself and for free. Mel said it was impossible for one person to do it for ten people in a timely manner and its easily thousands of dollars for work. Sandra threw a huge fit and Jay got really pissed off at Mel for being selfish by asking family to pay her instead of doing whatever she to help with the wedding and for dating to suggest strangers help her out. The invitations are going out this week, the wedding is eight weeks away and Jay says Mel isn't even invited anymore because of how she is acting. I think it's Jay and Sandra who are acting badly myself. I am considering not going because of how Jay is acting towards Mel. I wasn't going to butt in to the argument because it did involve me and Mel is perfectly capable of standing up for herself but Jay asked me for my opinion. He was expecting to me to back him up. The first time he asked I declined since it has nothing to do with me. The second time I told him he is acting like a groomzilla. Now he's fuming at me too though not as badly as at Mel because I'm still invited to the wedding. He definitely argued with me about it though?

"I (39m) have been married to my wife (32f) for four years. We usually get along just fine.

One of the issues that we've had since our relationship began has been about our freezer. Simply put, my wife stuffs the freezer full of food constantly. There is absolutely zero space for me to put anything in there.

At first, I tried to solve this by buying the fridge with the biggest freezer we could find. I dropped nearly $4 grand on it. She interpreted this as an invitation to buy *more* frozen food so she could play microwave dinner Tetris with the freezer. Every single nook and cranny is stuffed full. She still buys frozen foods and somehow finds a way to fit them in.

The worst part is when I buy a frozen food or freeze something for meal prep, she asks me at least three to four times a day when I'm going to take it out of the freezer. She essentially nags me until I remove the food from the freezer so she can put something she won't be touching for six months in in its place.

Last weekend I finally snapped and bought an inexpensive single door deep freezer. I put it in the basement near the washer/dryer and put a couple of my own things in there--mostly some frozen veggies and a few burritos. I didn't really mention it to my wife because she wasn't home when I brought it in.

When my wife got home later in the day, she went downstairs to do laundry and discovered my freezer. She excitedly ran upstairs to tell me that the upstairs one is full and she can actually fit more food in there now. I responded that under no circumstances is she to touch the freezer because it's mine. Not a single ice cube should be put in there. Then I told her to not even ask (because I knew she'd mention 3-4 times a day that she needs more freezer room). She sulked and tried to debate the issue, but I was able to placate her.

A couple of days later I went down to the basement to get something from my freezer, and there I found it about 70% full of microwave dinners. Upon checking the freezer in the kitchen, I found that it too was still completely fully. I calmly went downstairs with a large garbage bag, threw everything into it, and then tossed it into our trash bin. Then I found a padlock I had lying around and locked it with a chain.

Later that day my wife brought more frozen food to put into the new freezer, but when she got downstairs she noticed the lock and flipped her lid. She told me I was being controlling. When I told her that there's no way she will ever use that freezer again, she threw something like a tantrum and left for her mom's house. She came back later that day and told me that I had 24 hours to unlock the freezer.

Nothing really happened after those 24 hours, but now she's completely ignoring everything I say. I think my actions were justifiable, but was I wrong here?

**Edit**: thanks for the comments everyone.

Something weird here is that people assume I never talked to her about this. We've been married for four years. This has been an ongoing issue. Do you really think I've never brought up my frustrations when I tried to put something in the freezer? Do you really think her 3x a day ""Hey, when are you going to take X out of the freezer"" questions never resulted in any arguments?

I was clear in a comment too. I have suggested that she may want to talk to someone about her issue. She absolutely lost it on me, going as far as to threaten divorce. But people are saying I spent $4,000 on a freezer to avoid a conversation 🙄.

I just want to freeze a couple of fucking microwave burritos without being asked all day when I'm going to eat them. Unless I legitimately drug my wife and carry her limp body into therapy, she's not going. The people here who think that cOmMuNiCaTiON will make every single issue go away have obviously never had a conversation with a person who was incapable of seeing reason.",Not the A-hole,0
"Names of people have been changed for anonymity. To preface this I work in a typical department store everyone locally calls Freddy's. I've been there for a year and recently received a small promotion and raise. I'm striving to one day become a manager. And my boss seems to like the effort I put in. But someone who didn't was Lee. Lee I'm told had Aspergers and was with the store for nearly four years, and he was still working at the lowest level. But to be honest he only put in the minimum effort to his job.

Well my grandparents called me looking for a birthday gift for my nephew who was turning 6. I looked and found a particular Lego kit I knew my nephew would like that was on sale. My grandparents told me it was perfect and said they'd be there soon. I went back to work and my grandparents arrived a half hour or so later. And I accompanied them right to the toy isle to get the Lego set. I wasn't worried about grabbing one in advance as we had plenty of stock. And my grandparents wanted to browse the other options too. But the SALE tag for the set I'd recommended was somehow gone.

I was about to get on my walkie when Lee popped up from around the corner and said that SALE had ended the day prior. I told him I checked earlier and the SALE was still valid till the end of the week. Lee got in my face and said that he checked with the manager, and the SALE was over. I said I was gonna check again and Lee went off on me in front of my grandparents and several other customers. Fortunately the Manager Greg was nearby and heard the commotion.

Long story short Greg took Lee into his office and I found out Lee had listened in on the private phone call to my grandparents and removed the SALE tag from the Lego set when I wasn't looking. The security cameras confirmed this. And Greg terminated him for it. Lee cussed me out as he left and said he'd be calling corporate to get his job back. Greg also gave my grandparents a bigger discount on the Lego set and personally rang them up.

I thought everything was ok. But several of my coworkers and some other people who liked Lee have been upset with me. One in particular has been fighting with me for days. And told me I shouldn't have gotten the manager involved. And now Lee is gonna have trouble finding a new job because of his autism and a termination on his resume. I didn't feel guilty at first. But now....

So my question here is: AITA for getting Lee fired?",Not the A-hole,0
"My boyfriend and i bought our first house about 7 months ago and i only had one house rule. that his sister and her kids are not allowed over.

On top of this she is a horrible house guest she allows her children to trash his parents house when they visit im talking food smeared in the carpet, flooded bathroom and broken furniture. She refuses to clean up after them and leaves it for her parents when she goes home. It is because of this that I do not want her over at my house. As we were closing on a house my boyfriend's mom mentioned that his sister had a dining room table we could have and we politely declined by explaining that our dining room was too small for that table. Fast forward to today i come home from work and the oversized table was in my dining room. my boyfriend explained that his sister brought it with her when she came uo to visit his parents, I was pretty upset because we agreed that we did not want her bad juju in our house. I then later found out that she was actually over at our house while I was at work (she showed up unannounced and uninvited). For some reason she got his parents to show her shere we live under the guise that she wanted to give us furniture (that we already declined) just so she could be nosey and stick her nose in our business. Personally, i think she just wanted to make sure our house was not nicer than hers. I am very upset with my boyfriend for not turning them away and respecting my one house rule and i want to have a long talk with his parents about boundaries and i want that table out of my house!

I told my best friend this when he invited me but told me that I should go nonetheless since he already bought the tickets and said that it was going to be fun.

For a bit he convinced me, but I really started to think about it and didn't really like the idea of being there, silent and not really enjoying the music while everyone is jumping and singing with the singer. So I told my best friend last night that I decided I wasn't going and he got mad, not mad in the screaming at me way but kind of in a disappointed way, we were talking through the phone and he said that he didn't really want to talk and hung up on me.

We’re not from there, we’re from the Bronx. I have my stepdad down there, and the multitude of friends that we made in our three years of living there. The problem is that my oldest daughter is emetophobic, and my third oldest is prone to carsickness. So she’s thrown up in the car a couple of times. This rarely happens anymore but my oldest hates sitting next to her on car rides. My second oldest has a gaming laptop that she’s beinging and the only charging port is in the middle with the youngest. So that means that the oldest and third youngest have to sit next to each other. When I announced the seating arrangement my oldest looked extremely displeased with this but didn’t say anything. This is another thing that’s important, my two kids that will be sitting in the back don’t get along very well. I’m trying to get them to get along and I’ve even moved to putting them in the same room together.

"I(24M) am a marksman, I have been visiting a local gun range and participating in competitions since I was 18. After using club rifles for several competitions I decided that it would be worthwhile to buy a rifle for myself. This led to me purchasing a Mauser Karabiner 98k which was captured by the Russians in WWII. This rifle is my pride and joy and I have it displayed on a mantel above my electric fireplace when I am not using it. Aside from the rifle I also have several books on WWII on this mantel to create a mini history display.

My parents and friends have seen this mantel display and all have loved it. This was until my aunt and her children got involved. Due to not seeing them for over two years and them never having visited me in my apartment, I invited them over for dinner along with my parents. When the day came she came by early along with my parents to help with the cooking. This is when she saw the mantel and was curious at first and wanted a closer look at the rifle. Before pulling it down I explained that the rifle was a real WWII relic. Upon her looking closer at the rifle she saw the tiny swastika markings and was appalled.

This led to her demanding that it be hidden from her kids as she didn’t want her kids to see a real gun and the markings. I refused to put it anywhere but the mantel again which caused an argument between us. This led to her storming out of the apartment and the dinner being canceled.

"So my girlfriend (f25) and I (m27) both work and donate plasma to make ends meet. Over the summer, she had a pretty lengthy depressive episode and was unemployed for about 4 months. We blew through my entire savings to make rent, as she had no savings. 

She has since gotten another job and started a new medication that seems to help quite a bit, but she still struggles and calls in sick or avoids donating plasma so I've been continuing to contribute all of the money I would be saving to cover the deficit in her portion of the rent. She seems to only be motivated enough to keep us out of homelessness, but only barely. We didn't make rent on time last month. 

My dad recently agreed to help with expenses, but I'm afraid that if I tell her, she'll take that as liberty to contribute even less.

My first child (21F) got hers at 18 as she wanted to study in a different country and I can't afford to help her. For the most part she used it pretty wisely. My plan was to give it to all of them at 18 but when Kid 2 (18M) got his money, he hasn't been very smart with it.

I've spoken to them about it and explained my reasons. I know that as a single mom with a lower paying job, I can't really help them get started like I'd like to. And this is  several thousand dollars each. They won't see money like this again for awhile.

Unsurprisingly, they find it unfair (which it is) but can kind of see my side. AITA for keeping them from getting it at 18?


***Update*** 

Thanks everyone for your opinions. To clarify, for their ages, all my kids are pretty good with the small amount of money they get. The amount they're getting is well over 10,000 dollars so none of us really have experience with that much money. Son #2 isn't doing anything crazy with his share. 

Ultimately, it's their money. But I do think I have to the responsibility/right to express an opinion as long as I'm supporting them.

So I've decided that if the have a good plan at 18, I'll sign off on it.",Asshole,1
"I (13F) am currently staying at my dads beach house for the summer me and my sister (10) and cousins from my moms side, decided it would be a good idea to invite my dads cousins daughter (13F) lets call her Jane,to our beach house to stay over for about a week. Mind you we only see her once a year when we visit their home town to complete our vacation there so we arent that close. However when ever when we are there were always sleeping over at her place or our place.
She was never obsessed with makeup or staying out late until 2 in the morning type of girl. So when she came 3 days ago (alone) and we were going out at night i was surprised to see her applying on tons of makeup and doing her hair even tho we were just gonna chill around the pool so nothing special.
A little background info I dislike makeup and i honestly feel no need to wear it maybe just lipgloss every now and then but never with a full face not even blush. So when i saw her applying it i was rather surprised and made a comment that were not going to a wedding but just to hangout by the pool.
Side note she was taking an extremely long time to apply her makeup while i wanted to be there early before it gets crowded.
I went to another room and i applied a skin cream on my arms and walked in on me rubbing it and said why are you applying cream were not going to a wedding. And thats when my older cousin (15F) said its not like your the one that looks like your going to hangout by the pool (in a joking matter) thats when i said that i dont have to apply cream so i can go to a wedding. Next day same thing happens she wears a full face of makeup and alot of perfume, this time i just ignore and leave with my older cousin before any of them. That same day she makes friends and goes and hangs out with them the whole day.
It was getting late and around 12:30 me and my sister left and went back to the beach house.
Later at 1:30 I called them telling them to come back since it was getting late and she asked me if my mom said anything about them coming back and i replied with i dont think she knows ur still out. She murdered an ok and hung up.
I asked my mother if she knew that they didnt come home yet. She told me that she was aware and told me to call her up again and tell her to come home right away,and so i did. Minutes later they arrived and my mom told them that respected girls shouldnt be out late at night and that they should come home by 12:30. That same night Jane moved all her stuff to my older cousin's room. That same night my sister not aware i was listening told my mother that jane called me a snitch and an asshole when she came into the room after my mom scolded her from that day on we haven't said a word to each other.

"I am friendly with Bill, the best friend of my friend's ex. We all used to work together years ago. Bill and I text each other  for the holidays and I go out to eat with him maybe once or twice a  year.

I invited Bill to my  wedding with a plus 1. He RSVPed and said he is bringing my friend's ex. I let my friend  know just as a head's up and she flipped out. She couldn't believe I was  inviting Bill first of all, saying we aren't even that close and my fiance hasn't even met him in the 8 years we have been together. She  said even with me knowing how abusive and horrible her ex treated her why would I  even leave it open for possibility that Bill would bring my ex. I told  her how was I supposed to know? That is an unfair burden to put on me. In our culture we invite everyone we know for the red envelopes and then in turn reciprocate it when they have a big event. My friend thinks I am  full of shit and now she is saying she doesn't think she will come to my  wedding because of how uncomfortable she feels. She is one of my  bridesmaids though so I want her to suck it up.

I think she needs to grow up and learn to deal with people she doesn't like. It is my wedding and it is not like I am going to sit them at the same table.

So is she acting like a jerk or AITA?",Asshole,1
"Throwaway account. My former roommate and I had shared a two bedroom apartment since 2013, and he moved out about four months ago. We are on the East Coast of the US if it matters. Originally I was going to downsize to a smaller place, but I've decided to keep living there by myself indefinitely since I can’t really anything much cheaper, and have turned his old bedroom into an office.

The security deposit was $2500, which my roommate paid half of when we moved in. Now that he's moved out, he says I need to buy him out of the deposit. I'm a little apprehensive about this because I'm not sure how much of the deposit will get returned, which won't be until I vacate. I asked my father and he said most of the time the landlord invents excuses to keep the entire security deposit, so I don't want to pay him and be left holding the bag on this. My former roommate says he's always gotten his deposits back (I don't have any experience with this because this is my first apartment), and since we lived there for almost nine years the paint, carpet and other fixtures are past their life expectancy and the landlord can't charge us to replace them anymore. The lease was only the first year, after that it was month-to-month.

I told him I’m not buying him out and he’s going to have to wait until I move out to get whatever the landlord returns. He’s not happy about this and says I’m being a bit of an AH and forcing him to subsidize me, as well as putting his money at risk if I bail on rent/damage something, but I don’t know if any of the deposit money is coming back at all. Am I the AH here?",Asshole,1
"I (32f) have managed to upset and anger my mum due to going to my MIL and FILs house for Christmas Day instead of my mum’s.

A bit of background - my mum and dad have been divorced for nearly 15 years, and my dad has been married to my step-mum for over 8 years.  Mum never remarried and doesn’t like step-mum for various reasons (which I understand but don’t agree with), refusing to spend any time with her.

I met my now fiancé (36m) in 2017.  He’s in the armed forces and this year has been deployed over the Christmas period.  Due to the nature of his work I’m not able to receive any communications from him - I can send messages to him but won’t get a reply.

In the last 5 years I haven’t seen my mum on Christmas Day - this has been a mix of my mum going to my sister’s house for Christmas (she takes turns between me and my sister), my fiancé and I being at his parents house (one year that was supposed to be mums turn was at MIL and FILs house due to fiancé having not been at their house for Christmas for several years), COVID and last year us hosting Christmas for the first time in our first house together.  All of our parents were invited but mum refused to come because dad and step-mum were there.

This year I had initially decided that I would see dad and step-mum on Christmas Eve, and mum on Boxing Day, with me on my own on Christmas Day (I’m not really celebrating Christmas on Christmas Day due to fiancé being away - we’ll celebrate it when he gets home).  There had been no plans for me to see MIL and FIL however MIL had left an open invitation to go to their house so that I wasn’t on my own.

Last minute as I was driving home from my dad’s I decided I wanted to go to my MIL and FILs for Christmas Day as I wanted to feel close to my fiancé.  MIL was more than happy for me to turn up and stay.

Mum phoned this morning to wish me a merry Christmas, and MIL shouted merry Christmas in the background.  Mum is now furious that instead of me being at home alone or at hers, I’m at my MILs.  She feels that I am making no effort to see her at Christmas and that I prefer spending time with my MIL and FIL instead.  She is also alone this year for Christmas as my sister has recently had a baby and mum didn’t want to impose on her - I had honestly thought she would go to my sister’s to spend time with her first grandchild.

AITA for having come to my MILs instead of my mum’s for Christmas?",Asshole,1
"I (m29) went on four dates with a woman, I'll call her Jane (f29) and was really starting to like her. She decided to break it off because during that time, another guy (Russell- m30) who she had previously been on a few dates with reached back out to her and she said she had felt like there were some unsettled feelings there and she didn't want to take things any further with me until after she figured out what she might have with him.

So anyway, all three of us belong to some of the same circles: small town, mutual friends, church community, etc. A few weeks later I was introduced to Russell at a party. I didn't know if he and Jane were exclusively dating now or if he knew who I was, and that I had previously went out with her, but I figured having an upfront conversation might alleviate some potential awkwardness -- and I was curious if things were going to work out between them, because admittedly I still liked her.

So I asked him if he was dating Jane, and he said that they had been hanging out a lot but that they were just friends. At this point I mentioned that she and I had previously went out, but that she broke it off because she didn't want to lead me on while she was hanging out with him. Then he said that he had actually been meaning to talk to her about their friendship, because he didn't want to lead her on into thinking he wanted to be more then friends. 

After getting the impression that he wasn't pursuing her romantically, I shared that I had really liked Jane, and that I thought she seemed like she had a lot of unique graces for some of my past experiences -- I went through a divorce two years prior and developed situational depression as a result, and based on some of the deeper conversations we had over our short-lived relationship she seemed to have a sympathetic ear. But I also told Russell that, maybe I had too much baggage and scared her away- but she just didn't want to say that... Then Russell and I had a couple beers and talked about our other recent dating experiences with different girls we'd met on dating apps.

Then a few weeks passed, and I messaged Russell to ask if he and Jane were still hanging out, or what their situation was. He told me again that they were just friends. So I texted Jane with an inside joke, she responded ""lol"" and we each asked how the other had been since we last hung out and left things there for a day or two. 

Then the next time I texted her she responded telling me that she couldn't believe I would talk about her behind her back, and that she feels like she can't trust me or Russell and that she doesn't want to see me again. I don't know what Russell said to her about what he and I talked about, but I guess it was enough to feel like he and I both betrayed her trust. I tried to apologize for hurting her feelings, I didn't mean to gossip or to embarrass her, I just liked her and was curious if there would be a window to ask her out again in the future.",Asshole,1
"Some context: I (29m) own my condo and my girlfriend (29f) lives with me. She pays rent (around 20%) of the mortgage and though groceries are usually split between us, I pay for all the house-related expenses, like all utilities, any repair work, appliances that need replaced, real estate tax, etc.

We've been having a water leak in our house that an HVAC technician and plumber could not find for half a year now. Finally today, due to my downstairs neighbour's help, I managed to pinpoint that our HVAC condensate pump was leaking.

I temporarily put a baking sheet underneath it and kept it running cuz it's hot out. I called the HVAC technician to get it fixed but after a few hours, the sheet was already filled with water. I turned off the HVAC, told my girlfriend I turned it off and was going to DIY the fix tomorrow. She went to bed while I stayed up for a couple of hours watching DIY videos and researching what pumps to get.

When I go to bed a couple of hours later, she complains it's too hot and that we need to run the AC. She already had an electric fan on her but it wasn't enough. I reminded her that the HVAC is leaking and she says that she has work tomorrow and she needs to sleep now and she can't because it's too hot. She said that the leaks been happening for six months now anyway so what's an extra night?

I put my foot down and said that I don't want to make the damage worse. She reiterates that it's too hot right now and leaves the room.

A few minutes later, I hear the HVAC turn on and I realize she turned it on via her smartphone as we have a smart thermostat. I confront her about it and she repeats that she needs sleep, it's too hot, we've had that issue for months now. I said that thermostat issue aside, you going behind my back is a serious issue and now's not the right time to discuss it but we will need to talk about it in the morning.

I turned the AC back off, and unplugged the thermostat and she gets mad and says that it's not fair that I alone got to make that decision. And here's where I said that I do because it's my house and that I'm on the hook for house expenses so I get to make that decision. And she gets even madder, saying I basically said ""it's my house so fuck you"" (which I definitely didn't word it that way), saying that I'm too dramatic about ""needing to talk about it tomorrow"", and I'm not sensitive about how hot she is. 

I disengaged because she was upset and telling. Now I'm on the couch and feeling hurt because she went behind my back and is willing to sacrifice the condo for one night of sleep.

So AITA for saying that this is my house and that she couldn't turn on the AC? I know I could've worded it better but I feel like I'm being reasonable.

Edit: it's 65F outside and we have an electric fan as well.

Also want to clarify that water is leaking to our neighbors's unit downstairs, which is how I found the leak. The floors have also significant warping from the water.",Asshole,1
"A few months ago myself (25F) and my bf (27M) went out for a hockey game downtown. We ended up going all over town afterwards getting drinks and celebrating the win. We ended up walking to a nicer part of town and were grabbing beers when both my bf and I noticed men were looking at me very strangely. Saturday night bars are always this way and I didn’t think anything of it. After a while, my bf and I talked about how it would be funny if he walked away to see what these men would do. So he planned to walk away as if I didn’t know him and he was just another creep at the bar. Not seconds later, 3 older men (probably 30-40s) started up a conversation with me. I told them how I was with a friend and that I was just grabbing us some drinks. One man offered to pay, in exchange for chatting. I obliged, on the condition he would also buy my “friend” a drink. 

When the drinks came, I immediately told him thank you but I have to leave, as my “friend” messaged me and we needed to reconnect. I quickly walked over to my bf, handed him the drink, and we walked to a secluded outdoor patio away from the guy. According to my bf, the man looked at me, then my bf, and looked pissed.

Aita for snagging drinks off someone who offered to pay for them?",Asshole,1
"I was walking through the town I live near when I got hit with a very strong smell of, well, weed. I thought nothing of ot, its common around these parts. 

My issue was who I saw doing it. There were two employees who were clearly on the clock still at the near by fast food place, who were hiding on the property smoking the good stuff.

I walked a bit and felt as though this isn't passable. I wouldn't want two people handling my food if they were high out of there minds, so I contacted their manager on duty to let them know that two of their people were smoking weed on the property. 

Was I the AH for doing this and potentially making two people lose their jobs?",Asshole,1

AITA for naming my baby the same name as my cousins baby that was miscarried late in pregnancy? My cousin had a miscarriage late in the pregnancy after they had already announced the name.

My cousin is upset since it was a traumatic experience and feels name shouldn’t be used by the family. Am I the asshole for using the name any way?

Recently we went to target and she spent around $150 on clothes for me. Later in that trip, I ended up getting a $170 Lego set. About a week later, I had a job interview coming up and wanted to wear jeans. When I went to try on my jeans, they were all too small. I have not worn jeans for a while, so they were probably around 10 months old. After I found out that they don’t fit me anymore, I asked my mom if she could get me a pair or 2. She then started yelling at me about how she just spent over $300 on me in one day. She also was yelling saying that I should not have gotten the lego set if I knew I needed jeans. I did not know I needed new jeans. She also told me that she had no more extra money to spend, but then later that day, she bought a $400 Apple Watch. AITA?",Asshole,1
"I was coming home from work after 7pm on a New York MTA bus and had just bought cleaning supplies. I had 2 big brown paper style bags packed up &amp; a bookbag. I had the bookbag on the bus floor and a big bag on my lap and couldn’t fit the other bag on my lap as well without having any space at all. A woman (adult middle aged) gets on and has bags of her own. She obviously wouldn’t be able to comfortably fit next to me and would make it impossible for me to grab what i had in the event i needed to get off. She looks at me and i tell her “I don’t know where you think there’s enough room, I’m sorry”. She then goes back &amp; forth with me telling me to take the other big bag and put it on my lap as well or put it on the floor (already had a bookbag on the floor). I tell her there’s unfortunately just no room. She says I’m a man and that I should be standing and that I’m not the only one coming home from work (these looked like shopping bags tbh and i just got off a 12 hour shift where i stand the majority of the day with no seating). She calls me a “f*cking idiot” so at this point she gets me angry and i tell her there’s other seats or she can use the 2 legs she has to stand and that it won’t kill her. She says I didn’t pay for two seats while i responded that there’s no bag limits on NYC buses and that payment doesn’t guarantee a seat, when she should be mad at the MTA corporation for forcing fare for something that should inherently be free (travel) and not mad at me for the small bus seat sizes plus the fact that I didn’t make her pay the 2.75$ fare to get on, the bus driver did. A girl behind me moved over and the woman ended up sitting down but kept ranting about me so i turned and said “you’re still talking about it!?”’and she asked if “i was ok” in demeaning fashion so i said i was fine and that she was the one cussing at me causing a scene. I never do this but i feel validated because i got off the bus before her, proving my initial thoughts correct about it being too much to push past someone sitting next to me with all of these bags to hold.",Asshole,1
