Well, the game got leaked a few weeks early and people were already playing it. I was looking at videos on youtube like normal when I looked at the thumbnail for a recommended video, and its got a plain spoiler for the game. I am on the group that is waiting to play the game myself and avoiding all spoilers, so I was annoyed. I then noticed that next to it was another recommended video with someone playing the game early, but the thumbnail was a big custom \"SPOILERS\" warning. So I checked the channel of the guy with the thumbnail that had spoiled me, and noticed that he had like 30 videos with all spoiler inducing thumbnails. And that was what prompted me to comment on one of his videos. I\\'ll just put an image of the screenshots of what ensued since it is easier that way. I censored the names for obvious reasons, but the green censor is me. https://imgur.com/a/lAXxc Btw this is how it looks so far, if something new pops up I\\'ll update it.'],\n",

I feel terrible about this and have offered to purchase a new one for him.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHe is demanding a brand new, up to date, 4k version of the one he currently owns. I am more than happy to replace this for him but he has had six years of constant use out of this. I feel offering to buy a new replacement is reasonable and would even go and collect it immediately. He paid £650 six years ago and the one he is demanding is around £649. I have found one that is the same brand, the same size for £499, but only has one USB instead of the three he tells me he needs. He refuses to accept this.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAm I the asshole here?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nUPDATE - I ended up purchasing the tv he wanted in the end. He said it was the only one he wanted, it was my fault for breaking the television and causing him to go without, and if I didn't pay the money then he would just withhold the rent money he pays until it was paid for. An expensive lesson for me, but I take full responsibility and feel terrible about it, so at least it is resolved. Thank you for your responses.\"],\n",

Thanks again, this really helps.\\n\\nObviously this is a throwaway account. People know my usual account.\\n\\nI\\'ll try to keep it short.\\n\\nMy relationship with my bf (20m) (I\\'m also 20) has been mostly good but going downhill recently for a lot of reasons that aren\\'t the topic of this post.\\n\\nAnyway, over the last several weeks, every once in awhile my boyfriend will make sexual jokes at my expense and include \"our\" friends in the jokes; I say \"our\" because I am the only girl in this friend group and all of the other guys seem to prefer my bf. The jokes have been anything between implying I took part in a sexual act (which may or may not have been true, depending on what they joke about) to making a joke explicitly about me, saying something like \"OP must do X or act like Y in bed, hahaha!\"\\n\\nMy bf sometimes makes the joke, sometimes one of the other guys does. Either way he seems to think they\\'re very funny. I do not and have either explicitly told him so (calmly and only to him) or just tried to ignore it and avoid it through body language, etc. The jokes make me extremely uncomfortable. Nothing has worked obviously since the jokes still happen occasionally.\\n\\nToday it happened again and something in me just snapped and I couldn\\'t control the words before they came out. We were all at dinner at a busy dining hall at our university, and another joke was made. All the guys thought it was funny again. Suddenly I snapped at my boyfriend, but definitely not shouting, more like a very angry loud whisper (nobody else in the dining hall seemed to notice).\\n\\nI basically said \"Stop it. That\\'s not funny.\" Everyone at the table suddenly looked awkward even though I only addressed my bf. My bf looked flabbergasted for a moment before he looked angry and said (kinda paraphrasing) \"you do not speak to me like that in front of my friends. that is incredibly embarrassing and rude.\" I attempted to apologize, I said \"sorry for saying that like that,\" but he didn\\'t seem to accept my attempts to apologize so I dropped it. I think I only tried to apologize to keep him from being too mad at me. It would have felt wrong to apologize for trying to stand up for myself. Does that make sense?\\n\\nLater this evening, my bf said what I did is considered emotional abuse and that I have issues. None of my \"friends\" have said anything about the incident.\\n\\nWe are probably breaking up soon, but I want to know if I deserve my bf\\'s frustration.\\n\\nAITA for snapping at my bf in front of his/\"our\" friends?

       "        'First off: I have no problem with Vegans or vegetarians as I have a lot of friends who eat that way and I love how happy it makes them and how they have introduced me to lots of new foods and flavours. I will respect anyone\\'s diet as long as they respect mine.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIt started a few months back, my Vegan friend Ruby (alias) was crying to me over messenger about an argument she was having with our mutual friend who is am omnivore. I was comforting her and she was showing me the messages, most of it was more of a discussion about Veganism but there was one comment from Ruby that stated how she likened people who eat meat to animal abusers as they support an abusive industry. I called her out on this and her response was basically \"well it\\'s true!\" and I was simply trying to say that you just can\\'t say that to your friends even if you truly believe it. We stopped the discussion there because it was close to a massive deadline and we thought it better to focus and discuss it face to face.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMonths went by, the animal abuse comment was stuck in my head but we all got on and everything was fine for the most part until 2 months ago. Ruby watched this documentary showing the horrors of the meat and dairy industry called \"Dominion\". She sent me the link and asked me to watch it, she did say she would even give me the 80p it would cost to rent but it was 2 hours long. I watched the trailer and got the gist about what it was trying to show. I could have lied and said \"yes\" knowing full well I wouldn\\'t and I was also really pissed about the animal abuse comment that I genuinely felt like I was being bombarded by her views and if I had a different view point then she would blow up at me. It almost felt like she was putting conditions on the friendship: I turn Vegan/vegetarian or I am a horrible person who she doesn\\'t want to be friends with. So that is why I said no and it started an argument. I listened to her viewpoints and even spent a good few hours researching it all myself to get a rounded view and came to the conclusion that we should be more careful about where meat comes from but to me the answer isn\\'t for the world to immediately switch to a vegetarian diet (I can update with my list of reasons if anyone is that concerned). I managed to calm her but then said that she shouldn\\'t expect people to watch a 2 hour documentary just because she asked and I called her approach aggressive which to me it was. She blew up again and started shouting a lot of things at me over messenger. I simply tried to apologise for offending her while also defending my stance to which her final comments were along the lines of \"You should be the one apologising because you are an animal abuser!\"\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWe have had no contact since, I am unsure how much I want to save the friendship but what I do care about is not being able to see the rest of my friends in the friendship group because she will be there. I also felt like some of my friends didn\\'t give me much sympathy making me think I was actually in the wrong and should have just watched the documentary. If I did that then I would still be reeling over the animal abuse comment and nothing would have changed. Am I the asshole?'],\n",

       "        \"Me (18M) is in a situation where my friend, Daniel, (18M) has had history of sleeping with one of my friends, Louise, (18F). He then got with my girlfriends cousin, Carla, (18F) but he still tries to sleep with Louise. Carla is at a university a few hours drive away and is upset that Daniel has started using cannabis, mdma, Amphetamine and alcohol as a self medication. He's always told Carla not to worry about him but since she suffers with anxiety and depression it's easier said than done. Louise told me about how she was manipulated by him for sex. Whether it's through drugs such as mdma or alcohol and even emotional manipulation by him cuddling her and him moving in a way that would cause an accidental rub and then crying, saying how she makes him feel like shit and he'd start crying and saying how he wants to die etc. This continues but stops when they had sex. It only happened a few times and never when Daniel was dating Carla. He kept trying to sleep with Louise while he was with Carla but Louise kept saying no. I'm just wondering am I the asshole for not wanting to tell somebody who suffers with mental illness, who is all alone somewhere she doesn't know, that her first boyfriend who she loves is a manipulative drug user who doesn't look after himself and is always trying to cheat. It's really difficult as I don't want her to get worse all the way out there but I don't want him to hurt her.\\n\\nUpdate: I've decided to tell Carla and she is already soo much happier and is back to a spring in her step.
