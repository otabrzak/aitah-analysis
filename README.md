# Data fetching
Since the json dataset is currently too large to keep on GitHub, the `data` folder has to be downloaded from OneDrive and replaced manually.

# Creating a sample
You can create a sample through the script `create_sample.py`. Currently, the sample size is set to 20 000. When creating a sample of a different size, the name of the resulting csv is changed accordingly (a sample of size 1 000 000 will have an address of "data\samples\sample_1000000.csv").
